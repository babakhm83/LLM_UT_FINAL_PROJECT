## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Integration & Models

#### 1. **OpenAI-Compatible Gateway**

- **Base URL**: `https://gw.ai-platform.ir/v1`
- **Authentication**: API key via `AI_PLATFORM_API_KEY`
- **Available Models**:
  - DeepSeek-V3.1 (default)
  - Qwen3-32B
  - Qwen2.5-72B
  - gemma-3-27b-it
  - Llama4-Scout-17B-16E

#### 2. **BitcoinInvestmentAdvisor Class**

**Core Features**:

- Progressive timeout handling (120s ‚Üí 80s ‚Üí 60s)
- Fallback prompt strategies (full ‚Üí simplified ‚Üí minimal)
- Thread-safe parallel processing
- Comprehensive error handling

**Methods**:

```python
class BitcoinInvestmentAdvisor:
    def __init__(api_key, base_url, model)
    def analyze_price_movements_for_better_advisory()  # Hidden analysis
    def create_investment_advisory_prompt()           # Full prompt
    def create_simplified_advisory_prompt()          # Fallback 1
    def create_minimal_advisory_prompt()             # Fallback 2
    def generate_investment_advisory()               # Main method
```

### Synthetic Price Generation

#### 10-Day Price Predictions (Training Data)

```python
def generate_realistic_next_10_day_prices(base_price, market_sentiment):
    """
    Generates 10-day Bitcoin price predictions based on:
    - Market sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral)
    - Realistic volatility patterns (2-5% daily)
    - Trend factors derived from news analysis
    """
```

#### 60-Day Price Analysis (Hidden from Training)

```python
def generate_realistic_next_60_day_prices(base_price, market_sentiment):
    """
    Generates extended price predictions for better advisory quality:
    - Longer-term trend analysis
    - Cyclical behavior patterns
    - Mean reversion effects
    - NOT included in training prompts
    """
```

**Price Generation Logic**:

- **Bullish Sentiment**: 0.5%-3% daily growth, 4% volatility
- **Bearish Sentiment**: -3% to -0.5% daily decline, 5% volatility
- **Neutral Sentiment**: -1% to +1% daily change, 3.5% volatility
- **Historical Realism**: Price ranges adapted by year (2018-2024)

### Parallel Processing Architecture

```python
# Configuration
MAX_WORKERS = 40              # Configurable worker threads
TASK_TIMEOUT_SEC = 120        # Individual task timeout
PROGRESS_EVERY = 25           # Progress reporting interval

# Thread-safe processing
advisory_samples_parallel = []           # Results collection
advisory_lock_parallel = threading.Lock() # Thread safety
processing_stats_parallel = {...}        # Statistics tracking
```

**Processing Strategy**:

1. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Concurrent API calls
2. **as_completed()**: Results collection as they finish
3. **Progressive Statistics**: Real-time success/failure rates
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback prompts on timeout

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=40) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(worker_func, data) for data in dataset]
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result()
```

#### 3. **Error Handling**:

- Timeout detection and recovery
- Thread-safe statistics tracking
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Real-time progress monitoring

### Scalability Considerations:

#### Resource Management:
