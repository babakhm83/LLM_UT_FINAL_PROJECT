    "summary": "Bitcoin has successfully completed its fourth halving event, which historically precedes bullish price action due to reduced supply. The immediate aftermath saw record transaction fees driven by the launch of the 'Runes' protocol, providing a windfall for miners, though these fees have since normalized. Institutional adoption continues to be a strong driver, with major banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo offering spot Bitcoin ETFs, and analysts like Standard Chartered maintaining bullish year-end price targets. However, broader market sentiment, geopolitical risks, and upcoming tech earnings are also influencing price action, with traders focusing more on these macro factors than the halving itself in the short term.",
