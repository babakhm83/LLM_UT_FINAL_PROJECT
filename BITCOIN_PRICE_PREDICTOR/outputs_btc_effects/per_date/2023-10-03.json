However, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic with the continued strong performance of crypto ETFs and progress on institutional adoption, such as the Grayscale ruling and new futures ETF launches. Ether futures ETFs had a slow start, leading to a retracement in ETH prices, while Bitcoin's integration into the Cosmos ecosystem and new Canadian futures trading add to the evolving infrastructure.",
