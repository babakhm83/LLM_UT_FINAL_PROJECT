    "summary": "Today's market sentiment is heavily influenced by the unexpectedly high US CPI data, which showed inflation reaccelerating to 8.6% in May. This has triggered a significant sell-off in both stocks and cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin dropping sharply. The data increases the likelihood of more aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes, creating a bearish macro environment for risk assets. While there are some minor positive signals like reduced dollar bets and progress on EU crypto regulation, these are overshadowed by the immediate inflation shock.",
