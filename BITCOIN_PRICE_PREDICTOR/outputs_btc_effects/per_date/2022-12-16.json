    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing significant downward pressure today, with Bitcoin and Ethereum shedding gains made earlier in the week following the CPI report. Over $117 million in leveraged positions were liquidated overnight, indicating strong bearish sentiment. Further compounding the negative outlook, audit firm Mazars has paused work with all crypto clients, including Binance, raising concerns about transparency and potentially impacting market liquidity. Technically, Bitcoin is also approaching a 'death cross' on its weekly chart, a bearish signal. The launch of crypto futures ETFs in Hong Kong offers a glimmer of institutional interest in Asia, but the immediate impact is likely to be overshadowed by broader market fears of recession and the fallout from the Mazars news.",
