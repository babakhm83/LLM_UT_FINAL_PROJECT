However, the ongoing positive impact of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals continues to drive institutional interest and liquidity, as evidenced by BlackRock and ProShares ETFs surpassing GBTC's daily volumes. Binance's launch of an inscriptions marketplace and Valkyrie's addition of a second custodian for its ETF also point to growing ecosystem development and security enhancements. Despite the macro headwinds from the jobs data, the long-term bullish narrative for Bitcoin remains intact due to increasing adoption and infrastructure improvements.",
