On the regulatory front, Malta's passage of favorable cryptocurrency laws offers a glimmer of optimism, potentially attracting businesses. However, the dominant short-term narrative remains bearish due to technical breakdowns and macroeconomic factors like rising US Treasury yields and a strengthening dollar.",
