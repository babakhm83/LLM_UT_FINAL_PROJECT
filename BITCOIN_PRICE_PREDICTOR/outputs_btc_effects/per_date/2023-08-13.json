      "summary": "Despite a significant slowdown in U.S. inflation (CPI at 3%), Bitcoin failed to sustain its rally above $31,000 and pulled back below $30,500. This suggests that even positive macroeconomic news is not enough to break Bitcoin out of its current trading range. The market appears to be pricing in the reduced inflation without a corresponding surge in Bitcoin demand.",
