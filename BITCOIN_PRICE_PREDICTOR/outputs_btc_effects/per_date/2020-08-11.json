MicroStrategy's landmark $250 million Bitcoin purchase is a significant bullish catalyst, signaling strong institutional adoption and a growing narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. This is bolstered by other positive institutional developments like banks exploring crypto custody and growing interest in DeFi, particularly Ethereum. However, Bitcoin experienced a short-term dip, falling below key moving averages due to profit-taking, while USDC lending rates surged, indicating potential shifts in DeFi liquidity.
