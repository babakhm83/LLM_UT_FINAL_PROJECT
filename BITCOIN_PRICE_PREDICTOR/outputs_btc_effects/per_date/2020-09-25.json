However, a report highlighting a significant drop in crypto ETP volumes due to Bitcoin's bearish September performance points to reduced institutional liquidity. Regulatory news, like the proposed DCEA bill in the US, offers potential for future clarity, while a Russian blacklist of Binance introduces localized regulatory headwinds.",
