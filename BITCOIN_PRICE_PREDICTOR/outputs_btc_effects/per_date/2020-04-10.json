However, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic due to increasing institutional adoption, such as the sale of mining hashrate to institutional buyers and the potential for greater Bitcoin integration via platforms like Cash App. Macro factors like the Fed's asset expansion continue to support Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, though the rise of CBDCs and ongoing illicit activity concerns present headwinds.",
