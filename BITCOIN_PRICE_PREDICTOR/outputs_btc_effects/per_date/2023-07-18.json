The SEC's acceptance of Valkyrie's spot Bitcoin ETF application for review provided some optimism, but was overshadowed by macroeconomic concerns, particularly strong U.S. retail sales data suggesting further Fed rate hikes. Leveraged long positions are being liquidated, indicating short-term market stress.
