    "summary": "Bitcoin traded sideways as markets awaited Fed Chair Powell's Jackson Hole speech, creating a low-volatility environment. Positive sentiment in traditional markets and the confirmed dates for Ethereum's Merge provided some bullish catalysts for crypto. However, ongoing inflation concerns and potential impacts of sanctions on mining infrastructure introduce bearish undercurrents. The focus remains on macroeconomic signals for short-term direction.",
