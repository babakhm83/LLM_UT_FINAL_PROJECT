    "summary": "Bitcoin's price action remains in a tight range, with technical indicators suggesting a potential bullish 'golden cross' on the 3-day chart, hinting at a longer-term uptrend. However, short-term sentiment is mixed, with high-leverage trading on Bitfinex potentially increasing volatility. The relative strength of Bitcoin against Ethereum also suggests a potential short-term rotation into BTC. Institutional adoption continues with Lendingblock's new platform, while regulatory concerns from US authorities persist, creating a tug-of-war between bullish infrastructure developments and bearish regulatory overhang.",
