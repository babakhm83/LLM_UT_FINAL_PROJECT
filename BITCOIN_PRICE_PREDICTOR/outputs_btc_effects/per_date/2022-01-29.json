      "summary": "On-chain analysis using the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator suggests a bearish trend for Bitcoin. The MVRV Z-score has fallen into a range not seen since September 2020. This indicates potential downside risk and a shift in market sentiment from euphoria to fear or capitulation.",

    "summary": "The market sentiment remains cautious, with Bitcoin showing resilience by finding support from equity market rallies, particularly in the tech sector. However, bearish on-chain indicators like NUPL suggest underlying weakness. Regulatory pressures continue, with the IMF urging El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin adoption and US lawmakers probing mining companies' energy usage. Institutional investors appear unfazed by volatility, indicating continued long-term confidence. The strengthening US dollar presents a headwind.",
