    "summary": "Bitcoin has hit a new 2018 low, breaking below $5,900 and entering the $5,000 range, indicating strong bearish momentum. This price action is mirrored in altcoins, with analysis suggesting further downside. While there's ongoing institutional interest signaled by university investments and regulatory clarity from the SEC, prominent figures like Warren Buffett continue to express strong skepticism. The broader market sentiment remains cautious, with no immediate catalysts for a significant upward reversal.",
