    "summary": "Today's market signals present a mixed but cautiously bearish short-term outlook for BTC, while long-term fundamentals remain resilient despite macro headwinds. The significant de-risking from the Genesis/DCG/Gemini settlement offers a crucial positive catalyst, potentially offsetting immediate selling pressure. However, persistent global recession fears, continued hawkish Fed expectations, and a multi-day BTC price dip suggest caution. Miner production updates are positive but minor, and UK regulatory tightening adds regional uncertainty.",
