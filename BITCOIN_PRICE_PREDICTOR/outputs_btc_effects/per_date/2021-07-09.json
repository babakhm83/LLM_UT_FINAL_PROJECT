Short-term, Bitcoin remains in a tight range, with mixed analyst predictions and regulatory actions impacting sentiment. Square's hardware wallet plans and strong altcoin performance offer some bullish cues, while bearish predictions from figures like Scott Minerd and regulatory actions against exchanges like Binance create downward pressure.",
