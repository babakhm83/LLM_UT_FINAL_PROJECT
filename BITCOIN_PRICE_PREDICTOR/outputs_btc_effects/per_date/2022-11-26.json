This has provided some stability to risk assets, including Bitcoin, which has held its ground after recent lows. However, lingering concerns about contagion from the FTX collapse and negative commentary from prominent figures like Nouriel Roubini continue to cast a bearish shadow, creating an uncertain short-term outlook.
