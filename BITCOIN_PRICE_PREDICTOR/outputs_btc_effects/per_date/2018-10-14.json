      "summary": "Bitcoin is trading at a 2% premium on Bitfinex due to the suspension of USDT deposits into its HSBC banking account, forcing traders to use USDT for all transactions. As USDT's price has declined, this creates an arbitrage opportunity and indicates potential liquidity issues or a preference for direct USD trading on the exchange, which could affect short-term price dynamics.",
