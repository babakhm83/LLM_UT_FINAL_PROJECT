      "summary": "New research suggests that blockchains with free transactions are vulnerable to systemic attacks. The study analyzed transactions on EOS, Tezos, and XRP Ledger, finding that many transactions have little to no value or are internal transfers. This highlights the importance of transaction fees for network security and preventing abuse, which could indirectly affect Bitcoin's fee market dynamics.",
