      "summary": "Bitcoin remained stable above $26,000 over the weekend, while XRP and Litecoin showed positive movement, bucking the flat trend of other major cryptocurrencies. This divergence indicates selective strength within the altcoin market. The stability of Bitcoin above a key support level is a positive sign, but the broader market sentiment remains cautious, awaiting clearer macroeconomic signals.",
