    "summary": "Bitcoin has pulled back from its recent record highs above $100,000, with a 5% drop to $95,519. This correction is occurring amidst increased retail interest in altcoins and concerns about market volatility. However, strong institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, totaling $10 billion since Trump's election win, continue to provide underlying support. MicroStrategy's ongoing aggressive Bitcoin accumulation further reinforces institutional conviction. The market is also anticipating key inflation data later this week, which will influence the Federal Reserve's next move.",
