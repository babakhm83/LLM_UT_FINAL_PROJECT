However, high inflation data (CPI at 8.5%) continues to be a major concern, increasing the likelihood of aggressive Fed tightening, which creates a mixed outlook. While some altcoins are outperforming and institutional interest remains, the broader market sentiment is cautious due to macroeconomic headwinds. The potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval is a significant bullish factor, but regulatory hurdles persist.
