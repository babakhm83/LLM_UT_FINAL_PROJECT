Bitcoin is trading around the $30,000 mark, with mixed sentiment driven by ongoing regulatory uncertainty and positive developments like record ETP inflows.

Institutional interest remains high with continued ETF filings, but Nasdaq's delay in crypto custody highlights regulatory challenges. Political commentary from Robert F.
