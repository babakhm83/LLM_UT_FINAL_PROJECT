    "summary": "The market sentiment is predominantly bearish today, driven by a significant sell-off in Bitcoin (nearly 10%) and a broader risk-off sentiment across global markets, including stocks and commodities like oil. The strengthening US dollar and the failure of gold to break higher further reinforce this cautious macro environment. While there are ongoing developments in DeFi and institutional adoption, the immediate focus is on the downward price action and potential for further declines.",
