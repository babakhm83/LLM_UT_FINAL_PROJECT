      "summary": "An independent researcher predicts that Bitcoin's price could collapse if regulators target its energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism after Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake (PoS) with the Merge. The argument is that Ethereum's move to a more energy-efficient model might highlight Bitcoin's environmental impact, potentially leading to regulatory pressure or a shift in investor sentiment away from PoW-based cryptocurrencies. This could have long-term implications for Bitcoin's adoption and valuation if such regulatory scrutiny materializes.",
