This follows the ongoing speculation and positive sentiment surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF approval. A short squeeze has also contributed to a surge in prices and liquidations. However, the Poloniex exchange hack, resulting in a $125 million loss, introduces a bearish element by potentially eroding investor confidence and highlighting security risks. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with strong institutional interest signaling potential for continued upside, but security concerns remain a key risk.",
