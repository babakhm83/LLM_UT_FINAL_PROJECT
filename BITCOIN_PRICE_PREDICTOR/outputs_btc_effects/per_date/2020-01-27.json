This technical strength is supported by increased interest in the upcoming halving. However, broader market sentiment is being negatively impacted by growing fears surrounding the coronavirus outbreak in China, which led to a significant drop in U.S. stock markets, introducing a bearish macro overlay. The conflicting signals create a mixed short-term outlook, with technicals leaning bullish for BTC itself, but macro risks posing a significant threat.",
