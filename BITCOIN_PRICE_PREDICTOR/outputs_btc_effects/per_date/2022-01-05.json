    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable dip today, falling to a one-month low following the release of Federal Reserve minutes indicating discussions about shrinking the central bank's balance sheet. This hawkish sentiment from the Fed is a near-term bearish catalyst. However, some analysts suggest that declining retail interest could lead to a short squeeze and a potential recovery rally. Meanwhile, institutional adoption in DeFi continues to grow, with Aave attracting significant players, and innovative crypto dividend offerings are emerging, signaling ongoing long-term adoption trends. Altcoins like Osmosis and Chainlink are showing strong performance, potentially indicating a rotation of capital.",
