      "summary": "Bitcoin reached $49,803, its highest point since May 15, as it approaches the $50,000 level. The cryptocurrency is overcoming technical obstacles, including an April low and Fibonacci clusters. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $51,000 remains a potential hurdle. This strong upward movement indicates significant buying pressure and positive market sentiment.",

      "summary": "Glassnode reports that approximately 34% of Bitcoin's supply is held in dormant or potentially lost wallets. This indicates a significant portion of BTC is not actively traded, potentially reducing available supply for sale. The report also notes a return to dominance of Bitcoin exchange outflows, suggesting investors are withdrawing BTC from exchanges.
