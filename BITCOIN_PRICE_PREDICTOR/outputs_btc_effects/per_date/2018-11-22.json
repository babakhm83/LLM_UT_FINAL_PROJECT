This move aims to curb the energy-intensive nature of mining.

    "summary": "The crypto market remains under pressure, with Bitcoin trading around $4,500, reflecting a continued 'slow bleed' sentiment. While some smaller tokens are showing gains, the overall trend is bearish, influenced by macroeconomic factors like a strengthening dollar and the lingering effects of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. However, there are nascent signs of stabilization, with major coins experiencing only mild losses. Developments like potential institutional liquidity improvements from Bakkt and Fidelity, alongside new retail adoption channels in France, offer a glimmer of optimism for the longer term, but immediate price action is likely to remain subdued.",
