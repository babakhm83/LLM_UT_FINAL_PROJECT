      "summary": "This article claims Bitcoin has proven less volatile than stocks, referencing Federal Reserve actions and market reactions. It suggests that market participants react to Fed statements and press conferences. The assertion of lower volatility for Bitcoin compared to stocks is a contrarian view given its historical price action. If this perception gains traction, it could attract more conservative investors, but the underlying claim is debatable and might not hold significant short-term impact.",
