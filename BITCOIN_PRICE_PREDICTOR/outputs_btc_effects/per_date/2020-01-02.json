    "summary": "The market sentiment is decidedly bearish today, with Bitcoin breaking below the critical $7,000 support level on heavy selling volume. This technical breakdown, coupled with negative commentary from an economist and a general risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, points to continued short-term weakness. However, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic due to ongoing institutional adoption and positive macroeconomic trends, though regulatory uncertainties persist.",
