While the CFA exam's inclusion of crypto topics and the potential for increased institutional interest from Goldman Sachs' new CEO are long-term bullish indicators, short-term sentiment is clouded by geopolitical tensions (US-China tariffs) and the shutdown of cloud mining service Hashflare, which could dampen investor confidence. Bitcoin Cash is showing bearish momentum, and overall market volatility remains high, with rapid price swings observed. Efforts to improve crypto usability, like the Cryptassist database, offer a glimmer of positive adoption.",
