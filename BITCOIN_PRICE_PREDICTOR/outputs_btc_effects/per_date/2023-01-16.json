    "summary": "Bitcoin has surged past $21,000, outperforming traditional markets and signaling a potential shift towards risk-on sentiment. This rally is supported by moderating inflation data and expectations of a less aggressive Federal Reserve. Miners and average holders are now profitable, and options markets show increased bullish sentiment. However, the broader crypto market, particularly NFTs, continues to show weakness, and regulatory concerns stemming from past collapses like FTX remain a significant factor.",
