While the stock itself saw a weekly loss due to less dovish Fed cues, its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 could attract new investment flows.

This has led to significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs and a general cooling of market momentum, with MicroStrategy and Coinbase shares also declining. However, underlying long-term bullish sentiment remains strong, fueled by anticipated pro-crypto policies from the incoming Trump administration and continued institutional adoption via ETFs. The current price dip, coupled with extremely low retail sentiment, could present a contrarian buying opportunity for the near term.",
