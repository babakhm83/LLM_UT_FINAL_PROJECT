Technical indicators suggest bulls have regained control, with a potential retest of the 200-day moving average near $9,000. A break above $8,800 would be a strong bullish signal, while acceptance below $8,530 would weaken the bullish case.",

This contrasts with Ethereum's 3.79% gain, suggesting some altcoins are still showing strength. Longer-term, the hash rate remains at an all-time high, and Bitcoin's rally to multi-month highs continues, supported by anticipation of the halving and geopolitical factors.
