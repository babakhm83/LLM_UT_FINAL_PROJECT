This is supported by the anticipation of potential SEC approval for Bitcoin ETFs, a key institutional catalyst. However, broader market sentiment is mixed, with ongoing US-China trade war concerns and mixed economic signals like falling Treasury yields and consumer sentiment. Low Bitcoin ownership in the US suggests significant adoption potential but also current investor hesitancy. Meanwhile, a London remittance firm launching crypto services and positive regulatory news from Thailand and Malta contribute to a generally bullish outlook for adoption.",
