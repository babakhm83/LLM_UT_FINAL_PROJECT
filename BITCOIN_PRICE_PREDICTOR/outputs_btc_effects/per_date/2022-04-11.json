This is influenced by a strong dollar, rising yields, and concerns over tech stock performance, with some analysts predicting further downside. However, institutional interest remains evident with significant Bitcoin purchases by entities like the Luna Foundation Guard, and the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF continues to be a long-term bullish factor.
