Bitcoin traded just above $6,300, having been range-bound between $6,400-$6,500 prior to mild losses. The lack of significant price movement on such a notable anniversary suggests a lack of strong conviction from either buyers or sellers, indicating a period of consolidation rather than a directional shift.",
