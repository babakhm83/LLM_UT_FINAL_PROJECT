    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing a mixed sentiment following the first week of spot Bitcoin ETF trading. While inflows into these ETFs have been robust, Bitcoin's price has seen some retracement, creating short-term uncertainty. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates, remain a key driver. The ongoing regulatory landscape, with developments in Hong Kong and legal challenges in the US, adds further complexity. Overall, the long-term outlook remains bullish due to institutional adoption, but short-term price action is influenced by profit-taking and macroeconomic signals.",
