Despite initial enthusiasm during the 2017 bull run, many mainstream financial companies that were reportedly planning to open crypto divisions, such as Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, and Barclays, are now scaling back or exiting. This trend suggests a cooling of institutional interest, possibly due to regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.",
