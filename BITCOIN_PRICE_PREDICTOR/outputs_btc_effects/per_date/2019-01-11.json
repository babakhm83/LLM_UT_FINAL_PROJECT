      "summary": "The recent crypto market recovery rally has ended, with major cryptocurrencies erasing gains and falling back to monthly lows. A lack of fundamental support is cited as a key factor. News-driven momentum for altcoins has proven to be temporary 'dead cat bounces.' This suggests a continued bearish trend due to the absence of strong underlying catalysts.",
