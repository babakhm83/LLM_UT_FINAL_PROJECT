      "summary": "Bitcoin gained 3.4% on Tuesday, reversing a loss from the end of 2018, but failed to break $4,000 for a second day. It showed range-bound behavior, recovering from lows but struggling to sustain upward momentum past key resistance. This indicates a battle between bulls and bears near the $4,000 mark.",

    "summary": "The crypto market is showing signs of a potential early-year recovery, with Bitcoin up around 7% and Ethereum surging 19% in the last 48 hours. This positive momentum is occurring despite a bearish start to the year for Nasdaq futures, suggesting a possible decoupling from traditional markets. However, Bitcoin is facing resistance around the $4,000 mark, indicating a critical juncture for the short-term trend. Merchant adoption for Bitcoin Cash continues to grow, but its direct impact on Bitcoin is limited.",
