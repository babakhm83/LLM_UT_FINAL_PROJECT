    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant pullback, dropping below $23,000 as higher-than-expected US inflation data (PPI) reignited fears of aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes. This macro concern led to a broader risk-off sentiment, impacting equities and most cryptocurrencies. However, the emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals as a new use case and the resilience shown by Bitcoin despite a technical 'death cross' suggest underlying strength. Institutional interest remains a key factor, with MicroStrategy continuing its capital raising efforts.",
