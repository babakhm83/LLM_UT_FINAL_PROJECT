    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant rally, breaking key technical resistance levels and reaching seven-week highs, largely driven by escalating geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran. This surge positions Bitcoin as a potential safe-haven asset, mirroring gold's performance. However, subsequent statements from President Trump suggesting de-escalation could temper this safe-haven demand, leading to potential short-term volatility. Institutional developments, such as Coinbase Pro's Android app launch and BlockFi's support for new assets, continue to signal growing adoption and infrastructure improvements.",
