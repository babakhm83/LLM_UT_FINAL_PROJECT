    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable pullback, dropping around 5% amidst bearish sentiment and concerns over potential regulatory scrutiny from the incoming Biden administration, as highlighted by Janet Yellen's comments. This selling pressure was exacerbated by profit-taking and increased short positions in derivatives markets. However, broader market sentiment remained somewhat positive due to expectations of fiscal stimulus, which supported a weaker dollar and kept Bitcoin trading around the $35K level. Ethereum also saw a significant drop after reaching a new all-time high, indicating general market volatility. Institutional developments, such as BlackRock allowing its funds to invest in Bitcoin futures, offer a long-term bullish signal, but short-term headwinds from regulatory concerns and profit-taking are currently dominating.",
