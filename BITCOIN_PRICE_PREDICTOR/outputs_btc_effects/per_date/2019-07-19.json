However, a bearish short-term outlook for Bitcoin persists due to regulatory concerns and resistance levels, exacerbated by President Trump's critical tweets. Macroeconomic factors, like the potential for Fed rate cuts driving gold higher, could also draw capital away from riskier assets. Despite these headwinds, institutional inflows into Grayscale suggest growing investor confidence, while positive developments like funding for Bitcoin Core developers offer long-term support.",
