Long-term, positive developments include China's PBoC research center for digital currency and growing student interest in blockchain, suggesting future adoption. However, the ongoing SEC ETF denials and the Mt. Gox repayment loom as significant headwinds. Short-term, the widening spread between BTC/USD and BTC/USDT due to potential Tether instability is a major bearish indicator, potentially triggering a sell-off. Conversely, predictions of a crypto bull market amidst a stock market downturn, supported by institutional interest like Fidelity's, offer a bullish counterpoint. Coinbase's Dublin expansion is a neutral-to-positive infrastructure development.",
