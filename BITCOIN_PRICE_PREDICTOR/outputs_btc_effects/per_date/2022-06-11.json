    "summary": "The crypto market experienced significant bearish pressure on June 10th, driven by higher-than-expected US inflation data (CPI) which reached a 40-year high. This macroeconomic shock led to a broad sell-off across risk assets, including Bitcoin, which revisited sub-$29,000 levels. The correlation with the NASDAQ 100 was evident, with both markets declining sharply. While some altcoins showed minor support, the overall sentiment remains bearish in the short term, heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve's tightening expectations.
