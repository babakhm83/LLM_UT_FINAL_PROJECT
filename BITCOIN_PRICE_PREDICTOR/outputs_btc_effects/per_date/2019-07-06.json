This suggests a potential for altcoins to move more independently, which could lead to varied short-term performance across the crypto market.",

Long-term, institutional adoption and regulatory clarity (like the IRS guidance and SEC data requests) are key drivers, with positive implications for adoption. However, institutional analysis suggesting overvaluation and macro concerns like the US-China trade war introduce bearish elements. Short-term, retail adoption via ATMs is a positive, but technicals for some altcoins are choppy, and broader market sentiment (e.g., Dow Jones futures) could influence Bitcoin. Institutional interest remains a strong short-term bullish factor.",
