      "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a sudden 4% price increase, reaching nearly $26,800, as investors anticipated a lower probability of an interest rate hike in September. This positive price action mirrors a rise in the stock market, indicating a correlation with broader risk-on sentiment driven by macroeconomic expectations. The uptick suggests that positive sentiment regarding monetary policy can quickly translate into upward price movement for Bitcoin.",
