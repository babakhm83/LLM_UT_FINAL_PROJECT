However, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as the potential impact of the Evergrande crisis and upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls data, introduce a degree of uncertainty. Regulatory developments, like China's continued crackdown and the SEC's scrutiny of crypto lending, also add to the complex market landscape. Despite these macro headwinds, the technical strength observed in BTC and ETH suggests continued upward pressure in the immediate term.",
