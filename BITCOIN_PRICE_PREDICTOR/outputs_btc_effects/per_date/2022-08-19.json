      "summary": "Bitcoin experienced its steepest decline in two months, falling below $22,000 and reversing gains from softer U.S. inflation data. This sharp drop, the largest single-day percentage decline in two months, marks a continuation of a five-day downtrend. Ether and other cryptocurrencies also suffered significant losses. The price action suggests that macroeconomic concerns, particularly regarding inflation and potential Fed actions, are overriding positive inflation data in the short term, leading to a bearish sentiment.",
