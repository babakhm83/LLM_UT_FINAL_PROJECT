A Morgan Stanley fund held 58,116 Grayscale shares worth $2.018 million by July 31, up from 28,298 shares worth $1.3 million in April. This doubling down on Bitcoin exposure by a major financial institution indicates growing institutional conviction in the cryptocurrency market and could positively influence Bitcoin's price in the short term.",
