While venture capital and ICO funding remain strong, indicating continued interest and capital inflow into the broader ecosystem, Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing price stability and consolidation, suggesting a lack of immediate upward momentum. Macroeconomic factors are also at play, with a strong jobs report boosting the stock market, which could provide a tailwind for risk assets. However, negative sentiment from prominent economists and reports of regulatory tightening in some regions, alongside weakness in certain retail sectors, introduce bearish pressures.
