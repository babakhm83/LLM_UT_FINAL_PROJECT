This is largely driven by the ongoing correlation with traditional equity markets, which are also under stress. The short-term outlook remains bearish as Bitcoin fails to hold key support levels, indicating continued risk-off sentiment. Long-term, however, regulatory clarity in India and institutional interest in crypto infrastructure offer potential bullish catalysts, though the immediate impact of the global economic crisis on Bitcoin's safe-haven narrative is still being tested.",
