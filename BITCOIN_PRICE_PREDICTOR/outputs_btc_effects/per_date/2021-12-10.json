      "summary": "Bitcoin is under pressure as two-year Treasury yields rise to a 21-month high ahead of a key US inflation report. Higher yields suggest potential tightening by the Federal Reserve, which could reduce liquidity and risk appetite. The forecast for US CPI to reach 6.8% further supports this expectation, potentially impacting Bitcoin negatively.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies experienced a downturn today, with Bitcoin falling below $48,000, driven by concerns over rising US inflation (6.8% in November) and the potential for accelerated Federal Reserve tapering. Despite inflation often being cited as a bullish narrative for Bitcoin, the market appears more sensitive to the prospect of tighter monetary policy. The hashrate recovery and ongoing institutional interest in crypto funds provide some underlying support, but short-term sentiment is bearish due to macroeconomic headwinds and Omicron variant fears.",
