    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a slight pullback on Friday, trading around $31,428, but the near-term bullish trend remains intact. Long-term, El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender continues to be a significant bullish catalyst, while a Bank of America survey highlighting Bitcoin as a bubble suggests lingering institutional caution. Regulatory actions, such as the SEC's charges against BitConnect promoters and China's mining crackdowns, continue to shape the market landscape, creating a mixed sentiment.",
