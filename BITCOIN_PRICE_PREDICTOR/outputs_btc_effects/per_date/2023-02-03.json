      "summary": "High Bitcoin premiums in Nigeria (60% above market prices) may indicate a strong demand for U.S. dollars rather than increased crypto adoption, due to local currency depreciation and cash withdrawal limits. This suggests that the premium is a reflection of FX demand, not necessarily a bullish signal for Bitcoin itself.",
