    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable pullback, with its market dominance falling below 50% for the first time since 2018, while Ethereum reached new all-time highs. This suggests a short-term rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins, particularly Ethereum. Institutional interest remains strong, evidenced by significant inflows into Morgan Stanley's Bitcoin fund and the upcoming Dubai listing of a Bitcoin ETF. However, potential capital gains tax hikes and regulatory actions in countries like Turkey introduce bearish macro and regulatory risks. The reset of derivative funding rates offers a potential short-term bullish signal for Bitcoin.",
