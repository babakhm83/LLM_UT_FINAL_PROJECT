However, long-term bullish signals persist, driven by analyst predictions of explosive growth tied to the four-year cycle and potential political outcomes favoring crypto. The growing institutional adoption, evidenced by Taiwan's pilot program and significant staking deposits in Bitcoin protocols, provides a solid foundation for continued growth. Regulatory developments, such as Crypto.com's lawsuit against the SEC, introduce short-term uncertainty, while the potential movement of PlusToken-related coins poses a near-term bearish risk.",
