    "summary": "Bitcoin and Ethereum showed strong upward momentum, breaking key resistance levels and nearing multi-month highs. Positive developments regarding the U.S. infrastructure bill's crypto tax provisions provided a significant bullish catalyst, easing regulatory concerns. The performance of blockchain-linked stocks also mirrored this positive sentiment. However, Bitcoin faces technical resistance at the 200-day SMA, and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, as seen with the Poloniex settlement and the failed amendment to the tax provision, remain key risks.",
