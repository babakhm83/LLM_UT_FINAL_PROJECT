      "summary": "Bitcoin fell on Monday after reaching a record high on Sunday, as a sell-off in global equities curbed risk appetite. Some investors also expressed concerns about the rapid price increase. The cryptocurrency dropped to $47,400, a one-week low, losing nearly 17% of its value at one point. It later recovered some losses, trading down around 5.5%.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a volatile day, reaching new all-time highs above $58,000, driven by continued institutional adoption and demand for inflation hedges. However, a sharp intraday drop of $10,000 occurred following critical comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, highlighting sensitivity to regulatory sentiment. Broader market sentiment also played a role, with a potential stock market bubble warning from Bank of America suggesting a risk-off environment could impact crypto. Despite the short-term volatility, the long-term outlook remains positive due to increasing retail and institutional interest, with significant capital expected to flow into the asset class.",
