This indicates a flight to safety and a potential hedge against rising prices. Bitcoin's positioning as a potential inflation hedge could see increased interest if this trend continues.",

Long-term, regulatory uncertainty persists with U.S. regulators signaling increased oversight, while institutional caution from figures like the UBS Chairman remains a bearish factor. However, the growing adoption of crypto by mainstream platforms like Robinhood offers a bullish counterpoint. Short-term, inflation fears are driving a rally in gold, potentially benefiting Bitcoin's 'digital gold' narrative. Conversely, Coinbase's restriction on credit card purchases could hinder new retail investor onboarding, and negative commentary from influential investors like Charlie Munger adds to bearish sentiment.",
