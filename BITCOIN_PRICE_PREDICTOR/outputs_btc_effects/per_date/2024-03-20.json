This correction occurred despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady and maintaining its projection for three rate cuts this year, a generally dovish signal that boosted stock markets to new records. Meanwhile, Ethereum faced headwinds as reports surfaced of regulatory inquiries into the Ethereum Foundation, dimming hopes for ETH ETF approvals in May. Despite these mixed signals, some altcoins and mining stocks saw gains, indicating sector-specific strength amidst broader market volatility.",
