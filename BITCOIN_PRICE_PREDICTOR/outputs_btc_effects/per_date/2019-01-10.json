      "summary": "The Federal Reserve's dovish minutes, suggesting a pause in interest rate hikes, initially boosted stocks but led to a negative reaction in the crypto market, with an $11 billion loss in 5 hours. This suggests a decoupling or a negative correlation in the short term, possibly due to profit-taking or a flight to perceived safety in traditional markets.",

This decline was accompanied by a drop in bullish bets and a negative reaction to dovish Fed minutes, suggesting profit-taking and a flight to traditional assets.
