    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced significant selling pressure today, with record outflows from spot ETFs driving the price below $58,000. This is attributed to retail investors taking profits and a general cooling of enthusiasm. However, the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rates provided some support, preventing a steeper decline. MicroStrategy's continued Bitcoin accumulation and Fidelity's analysis on decreasing Bitcoin volatility offer longer-term bullish signals, but short-term sentiment is decidedly bearish due to ETF outflows and retail profit-taking.",
