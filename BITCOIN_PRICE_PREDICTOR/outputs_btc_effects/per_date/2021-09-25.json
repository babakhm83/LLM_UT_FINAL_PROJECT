    "date": "2021-09-25",
    "summary": "The crypto market experienced significant selling pressure on September 25th, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing substantial price drops and breaking key support levels. This downturn is attributed to ongoing regulatory concerns, particularly China's intensified crackdown on crypto transactions and exchanges like Huobi ceasing operations for Chinese users. Negative sentiment from social media influencers also contributed to the bearish mood. Despite these short-term headwinds, long-term institutional adoption continues with major banks launching Bitcoin funds and exchanges securing significant sponsorships.",
