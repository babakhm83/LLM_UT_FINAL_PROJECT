Originally a joke, its rapid rise is attributed to support from figures like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. This surge in popularity and adoption, even for a meme coin, indicates a broader speculative interest in the crypto market. The attention Dogecoin is receiving could spill over into other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, by drawing more retail traders into the space.",
