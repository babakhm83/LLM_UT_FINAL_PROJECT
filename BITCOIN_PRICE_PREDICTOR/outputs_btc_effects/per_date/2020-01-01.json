While the annual recap of 2019 highlights a strong 88% gain for Bitcoin and a general sentiment that 'cryptocurrencies are here to stay,' with reduced regulatory concerns, immediate price action on January 1st shows a slight bearish trend with Bitcoin failing to hold resistance and breaking support. Counteracting this, a prominent economist has labeled Bitcoin a 'pyramid scheme,' introducing significant negative sentiment that could deter investors. The long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic due to increasing institutional adoption and the development of state-backed digital currencies.",
