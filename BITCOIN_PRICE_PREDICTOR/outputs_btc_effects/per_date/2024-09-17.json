      "summary": "BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw its first net inflows in 14 days, receiving $15.8 million on Monday. This breaks a streak of flat or negative flows.

    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable surge to $61K ahead of the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate decision, with positive inflows into BlackRock's ETF offering a glimmer of optimism. However, significant sell orders at resistance levels and a general market caution ahead of the Fed meeting suggest potential for capped gains and volatility. MicroStrategy's continued debt offering to buy Bitcoin provides a consistent demand signal. Meanwhile, political developments, including Trump's new crypto venture and ongoing discussions on crypto legislation, add layers of uncertainty and potential long-term influence.",
