This volatility comes ahead of key macroeconomic data (CPI) and central bank decisions (Fed). Despite the short-term pullback, the long-term outlook remains bullish, primarily driven by ongoing progress and anticipation surrounding spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, with major asset managers like VanEck and Fidelity actively preparing their filings. Mining stocks were also hit hard by the price drop, indicating sector-wide sensitivity to Bitcoin's price action.",
