Ether also saw significant short liquidations, suggesting broader market deleveraging. However, positive developments include the launch of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Australia, signaling continued institutional interest, and ongoing investment in Lightning Network infrastructure. The dollar's dip on hopes of peaking inflation offers a slight counter-narrative, but the immediate outlook remains cautious.",
