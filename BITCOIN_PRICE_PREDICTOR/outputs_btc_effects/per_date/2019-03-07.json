Long-term, institutional interest remains cautious due to regulatory uncertainty, but developments like Bakkt's acquisition and positive sentiment from Japan regarding ETFs offer bullish undercurrents. Short-term, Bitcoin faces key resistance levels, with recent transaction volume increases and strong altcoin performance (like BNB) providing some bullish momentum. However, regulatory actions like Canada's tax audits and France's potential privacy coin ban introduce bearish risks and potential volatility.",
