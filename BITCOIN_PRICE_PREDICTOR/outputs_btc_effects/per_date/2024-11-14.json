    "summary": "Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs, driven by optimism surrounding Donald Trump's election and anticipated pro-crypto policies. This surge is supported by positive inflation data that suggests the Federal Reserve may continue with rate cuts, although Fed Chair Powell's hawkish comments have introduced some caution, leading to a slight pullback in risk assets. Institutional interest remains strong, with a significant portion planning to increase crypto allocations, further bolstering bullish sentiment. However, the market is now closely watching for any shifts in Fed policy and the actual implementation of proposed crypto-friendly regulations.",
