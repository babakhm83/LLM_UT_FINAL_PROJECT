Options traders are increasingly bullish, anticipating a $100K target, supported by a more favorable macro outlook from the Fed's stance on interest rates. However, regulatory scrutiny on platforms like Robinhood and the SEC's delay on an Ethereum ETF introduce some bearish headwinds. Developments in Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions and positive commentary from figures like Arthur Hayes suggest potential for short-term upside, while mining operations provide mixed signals.",
