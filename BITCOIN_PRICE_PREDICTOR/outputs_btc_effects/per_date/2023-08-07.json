This indicates strong conviction among long-term investors who are less likely to sell, reducing the available supply for trading.

Long-term, the continued push for spot Bitcoin ETFs by major institutions like BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco, coupled with regulatory clarity efforts from figures like Senator Lummis, remains a strong bullish narrative. MicroStrategy's ongoing accumulation and a decrease in exchange supply further support this. Short-term, PayPal's stablecoin launch and the end of institutional shorting on Bitcoin are positive catalysts. However, some cryptocurrencies like XRP are experiencing declines, and overall market sentiment is cautious due to regulatory concerns and upcoming macro data.
