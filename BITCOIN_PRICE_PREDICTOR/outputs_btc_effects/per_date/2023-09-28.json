He remained tight-lipped about the SEC's approach to spot Bitcoin ETFs post-legal setback.

    "summary": "The crypto market is showing mixed signals today. Long-term, positive developments include institutional adoption via Deutsche Bank's crypto services and the potential for spot Bitcoin ETFs, supported by favorable regulatory rulings. MicroStrategy's continued Bitcoin accumulation also provides a bullish backdrop. However, short-term sentiment is cautious, with traders leaning bearish and concerns about rising oil prices and potential Fed rate hikes creating headwinds. Regulatory uncertainty from SEC Chair Gensler's comments and the EU's focus on crypto's environmental impact add to the mixed outlook. The launch of new crypto futures ETFs by VanEck and Valkyrie, along with Coinbase's expansion into derivatives for non-US retail, are positive for liquidity and adoption.",
