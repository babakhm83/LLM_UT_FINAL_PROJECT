      "summary": "New York's State Legislature passed a bill that would impose a two-year moratorium on using fossil-fuel power plants for cryptocurrency mining. Governor Kathy Hochul has not yet decided whether to sign it. If enacted, this could impact mining operations in the state, potentially leading to relocation or increased costs for miners relying on such energy sources. This regulatory development could create short-term uncertainty and affect mining profitability.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin showed a positive trend today, gaining over 5% and breaking above key resistance levels, driven by investors rotating out of more volatile altcoins. This is supported by continued inflows into Bitcoin funds, signaling institutional preference. However, broader macroeconomic concerns, including recession fears and potential interest rate hikes, continue to cast a shadow. Regulatory developments, such as the New York mining moratorium bill, introduce short-term uncertainty. Overall, the short-term sentiment appears cautiously optimistic for Bitcoin due to these inflows and price action, but long-term headwinds from macroeconomics and regulation persist.",
