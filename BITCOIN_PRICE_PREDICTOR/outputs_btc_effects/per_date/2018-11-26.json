      "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a 15% recovery from its 14-month low of $3,474, potentially opening the door for short-term consolidation. The cryptocurrency had fallen below a key trendline support. While the drop was significant, the bounce back suggests oversold conditions may be at play. However, the overall trend remains bearish, and this recovery might be a temporary relief before further price discovery.",
