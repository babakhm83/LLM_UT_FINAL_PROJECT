      "summary": "Despite a 70% drop from its peak, Bitcoin's bear market shows a silver lining: both small and large investors have consistently bought on dips, unlike in previous bear markets. This consistent buying behavior suggests strong conviction among investors, even during market downturns. Such accumulation could lay the groundwork for a future recovery and indicates a potentially more mature market.",
