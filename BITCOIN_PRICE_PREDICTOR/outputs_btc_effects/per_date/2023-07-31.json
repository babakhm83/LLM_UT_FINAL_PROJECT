Simultaneously, the Curve Finance exploit poses a DeFi-specific risk, potentially impacting broader market liquidity. On the bullish side, positive commentary from Mike Novogratz regarding Larry Fink's embrace of Bitcoin and ongoing analyst optimism for MicroStrategy offer some counter-narrative. Political endorsements from figures like Ron DeSantis and RFK Jr. add a layer of speculative interest but are unlikely to drive immediate price action.",
