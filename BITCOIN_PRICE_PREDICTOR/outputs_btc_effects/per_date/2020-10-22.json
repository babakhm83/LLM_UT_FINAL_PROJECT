Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones reiterated his bullish stance, calling the rally the 'first inning.' While some experts express reservations about PayPal's crypto offering's limitations, the overall sentiment remains strongly bullish due to institutional adoption signals from PayPal, Square, and Grayscale. Traders are also rotating from altcoins to Bitcoin, increasing its dominance. However, a slight dip in DeFi TVL suggests some consolidation in that sector.",
