      "summary": "Bitcoin's mining difficulty has reached a new all-time high, increasing by 9.32% to 26.64 trillion. This adjustment is a direct result of increased computational power (hashrate) on the network, aiming to maintain the average block mining time at around 10 minutes. A higher difficulty indicates more miners are participating and investing in the network, which is a positive sign for its security and robustness.",

This broad market weakness has invalidated the decoupling narrative for altcoins. Negative sentiment is amplified by a major hack at Crypto.com and ongoing regulatory discussions around Bitcoin mining's environmental impact. However, El Salvador's continued Bitcoin purchases and Twitter's NFT profile picture integration offer minor bullish counterpoints.",
