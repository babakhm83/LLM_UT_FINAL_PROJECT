    "summary": "Bitcoin showed resilience, finishing the week with a notable gain and showing signs of decoupling from traditional markets, despite mixed global economic signals. The crypto mining difficulty saw its largest drop in a year due to heatwaves impacting operations in Texas, indicating potential miner capitulation. Meanwhile, Ethereum's upcoming 'Merge' upgrade continues to be a strong bullish narrative, with potential for deflationary supply. Regulatory scrutiny remains a key concern, with the SEC reportedly probing TerraUSD, while macro factors like interest rate hikes and energy security in Europe continue to cast a shadow.",
