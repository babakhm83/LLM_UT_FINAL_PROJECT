Institutional interest is growing with Coinbase's acquisition of Tagomi and new hybrid IRA offerings. However, negative sentiment from Goldman Sachs and ongoing legal battles like the Craig Wright case introduce some uncertainty. The halving event's long-term bullish impact remains a key narrative, while short-term price action will likely be influenced by macroeconomic trends and investor sentiment.",
