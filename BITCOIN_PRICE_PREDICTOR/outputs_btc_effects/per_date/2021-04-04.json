Ethereum, however, showed resilience, retesting its all-time high as support, suggesting potential for further upside. Institutional adoption continues to be a strong long-term driver, with MicroStrategy and Square's investments performing well, and positive commentary from figures like Elon Musk and institutions like Citi reinforcing Bitcoin's legitimacy. Regulatory clarity efforts in the US are also a positive long-term factor. Short-term sentiment is mixed, with concerns about outflows and the impact of new DeFi projects on liquidity.",
