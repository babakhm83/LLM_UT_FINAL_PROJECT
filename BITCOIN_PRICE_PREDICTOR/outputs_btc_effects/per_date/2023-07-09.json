    "summary": "The long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains cautiously optimistic, primarily driven by the ongoing pursuit of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major financial institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock, which could unlock significant institutional capital. However, regulatory headwinds in regions like the EU, with potential for stricter capital requirements for crypto, present a bearish counterpoint. In the short term, market sentiment is mixed, with a lack of major adoption or regulatory catalysts. While insider buying in crypto-related firms and political endorsements offer minor bullish signals, a decline in developer activity suggests potential innovation slowdowns. Overall, the market appears to be in a consolidation phase, awaiting clearer regulatory guidance and institutional adoption triggers.",
