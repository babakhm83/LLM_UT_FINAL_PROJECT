This bearish short-term outlook is compounded by ongoing regulatory scrutiny, as seen with the CFTC's action against a crypto Ponzi scheme and Telegram's dispute with the SEC. However, positive developments like the increased adoption of SegWit, the growth in OTC volumes, and the launch of new infrastructure like the Lightning authentication tool provide long-term bullish undercurrents.
