It suggests that traditional financial systems are prone to such schemes, implying that decentralized digital assets offer a more transparent alternative. The scandal involved misuse of a sovereign wealth fund, with Goldman Sachs bankers allegedly facilitating the embezzlement for luxury purchases.",
