      "summary": "Bitcoin surpassed $71,000, with Ether crossing $4,000, partly driven by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) removing objections to crypto-based Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs). This regulatory development in the UK opens doors for greater institutional involvement in crypto. While the immediate price jump is positive, the underlying regulatory shift signals a more sustained inflow of institutional capital.",

    "summary": "The market is experiencing mixed signals. Hotter-than-expected US inflation data is dampening rate cut expectations, leading to a pullback in global stocks and a bearish short-term outlook for Bitcoin. However, long-term sentiment remains largely bullish, driven by strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and positive expert predictions. The UK's regulatory move to allow crypto ETNs adds a bullish catalyst, while a recent sharp correction in Bitcoin after hitting record highs highlights ongoing volatility.",
