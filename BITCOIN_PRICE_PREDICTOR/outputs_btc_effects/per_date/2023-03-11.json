    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing significant turmoil following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Silvergate Bank. This has led to a depeg of USDC, a crash in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, and widespread liquidations. While some traders are looking past the immediate fears, the contagion risk from the banking sector remains a dominant bearish factor. However, positive developments like the growth of the Lightning Network for payments and Coinbase's L2 scaling solution offer potential long-term bullish signals.",
