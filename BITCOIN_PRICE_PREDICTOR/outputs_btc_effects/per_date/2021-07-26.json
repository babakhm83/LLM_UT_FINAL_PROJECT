      "summary": "Bitcoin buyers were active over the weekend, breaking above the 50-day moving average near $34,000. The intermediate-term downtrend is reversing, though resistance near $40,000 could trigger profit-taking. Upside momentum is improving after months of consolidation and oversold readings.",
