This event overshadowed positive sentiment from Donald Trump's pro-crypto remarks at the Bitcoin conference and his promise to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler. While transaction fees remain low, indicating network efficiency, the market is currently dominated by concerns over large government holdings and mixed ETF flows, with Ether ETFs seeing outflows. The potential for regulatory shifts under a Trump presidency and bipartisan support for crypto offer long-term bullish signals, but short-term volatility is high.",
