A major exchange hack at KuCoin (over $150M lost) introduces significant bearish sentiment and liquidity concerns, likely impacting prices negatively in the short term. Conversely, positive developments in Ethereum 2.0, such as the 'burn' mechanism, offer a bullish outlook for ETH. Macroeconomic factors, including potential stock market weakness and a strengthening dollar, suggest a broader risk-off environment that could pressure Bitcoin. However, long-term institutional adoption trends, exemplified by MicroStrategy's BTC treasury allocation, remain a strong bullish tailwind.",
