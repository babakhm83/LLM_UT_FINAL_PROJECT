    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a volatile trading day, breaking resistance but failing to hold gains above $51,000, indicating immediate selling pressure. Long-term, institutional adoption continues to be a strong bullish signal, with major banks like Morgan Stanley increasing their GBTC holdings and JPMorgan opening crypto access to wealthy clients. Google's move to allow crypto ads and projections of significant market growth by 2030 further reinforce the long-term bullish outlook. However, short-term sentiment remains mixed due to resistance levels and ongoing debates about NFT valuations.",
