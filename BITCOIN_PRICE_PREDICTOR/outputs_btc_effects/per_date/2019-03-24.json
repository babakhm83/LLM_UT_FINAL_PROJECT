      "summary": "Following a Bitwise investigation revealing that at least 95% of Bitcoin trading volume on unregulated exchanges is faked, the common response is 'everyone already knew that.' This widespread acknowledgment of wash trading suggests that while the news itself might not be a shock, it reinforces existing skepticism about market integrity. This could lead to a short-term dip in confidence and potentially price, as the market grapples with the implications of manipulated volume data.",
