      "summary": "The amount of tokenized Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Ethereum network has significantly increased in June. This trend, where Bitcoin is 'wrapped' into an ERC-20 token, highlights the growing synergy between Bitcoin and Ethereum, particularly within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The increase in WBTC suggests more Bitcoin holders are utilizing Ethereum's DeFi applications, potentially increasing demand for ETH and driving innovation in cross-chain interoperability.",
