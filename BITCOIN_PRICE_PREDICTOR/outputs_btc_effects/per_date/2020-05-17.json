This event, occurring roughly every four years, is designed to control Bitcoin's inflation by slowing the rate at which new coins enter circulation. Historically, halvings have been associated with price increases due to the reduced supply, though the immediate post-halving period can see volatility. This event is crucial for understanding Bitcoin's long-term supply dynamics and potential price appreciation.",
