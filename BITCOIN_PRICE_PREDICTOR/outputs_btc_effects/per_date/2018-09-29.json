Long-term, positive developments include educational initiatives in blockchain, regulatory clarity in France, and institutional interest signaled by Canada's mutual fund approval and Citigroup's custody plans. However, the ongoing lack of Bitcoin ETFs remains a hurdle. Short-term, Bitcoin found support and is showing a corrective bounce, while positive sentiment from figures like Mike Novogratz is present. Conversely, concerns about Tether's market impact and potential institutional risks from former Wall Street executives introduce uncertainty. Ransomware attacks demanding Bitcoin are a recurring, low-impact risk.",
