      "summary": "Standard Chartered has projected that Bitcoin could reach $120,000 by the end of 2024. This optimistic outlook is attributed to factors such as miners hoarding their coins, which reduces supply. The bank's analysis suggests that if Bitcoin's price rises to $50,000, miners might sell only 20-30% of their newly mined coins to cover costs, further decreasing circulating supply and potentially driving up the price. This forecast highlights the potential impact of miner behavior and supply dynamics on Bitcoin's long-term valuation.",
