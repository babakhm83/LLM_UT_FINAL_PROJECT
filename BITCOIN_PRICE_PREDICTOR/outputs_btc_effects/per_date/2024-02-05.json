However, the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs is facing a temporary slowdown due to institutional due diligence, potentially impacting inflows.

Analyst Markus Thielen offers a bullish $70K Bitcoin target for year-end, citing macro factors and ETF demand. Conversely, rising interest rates and hawkish Fed commentary from Chair Powell are creating headwinds, leading to a slip in Bitcoin prices and declines in crypto-related stocks.
