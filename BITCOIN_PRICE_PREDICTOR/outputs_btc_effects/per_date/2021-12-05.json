      "summary": "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced the purchase of an additional 150 bitcoins following a price slump. This move enlarges the country's bet on the cryptocurrency, despite criticism. Bitcoin is down approximately 30% from its November 10th high. This \"buy the dip\" strategy by a nation-state could signal confidence and potentially stabilize prices in the short term.",
