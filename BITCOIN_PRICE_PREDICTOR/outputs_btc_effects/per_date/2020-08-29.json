    "summary": "Bitcoin showed resilience on Friday, closing higher and maintaining its near-term bullish trend, despite some late pullback. Macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly regarding Federal Reserve policy, continues to be a background factor influencing sentiment. Long-term, regulatory clarity from the OCC for banks and the SEC's approval of a security token IPO are significant bullish catalysts, while the lingering impact of the Twitter hack poses a bearish risk. Miner expansion and adoption of technologies like SegWit are positive infrastructure developments.",
