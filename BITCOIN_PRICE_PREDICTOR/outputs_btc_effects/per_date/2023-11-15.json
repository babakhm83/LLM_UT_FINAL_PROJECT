This macro backdrop led to a broad rally in traditional markets, with major indices posting substantial gains and bond yields plunging. The crypto market, including Bitcoin, is benefiting immensely from this risk-on sentiment and the anticipation of a Fed pause. The potential for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals remains a key long-term driver, with recent news indicating the SEC is entering a decision period.",
