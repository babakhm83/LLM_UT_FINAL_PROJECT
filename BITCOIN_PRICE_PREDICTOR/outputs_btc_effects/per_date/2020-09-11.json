Meanwhile, Uniswap's total value locked (TVL) experienced volatility. The lack of strong price action for Bitcoin suggests a consolidation phase, while the volatility in Uniswap's TVL indicates ongoing activity and potential shifts within the DeFi space. This mixed picture suggests caution in the short term.",
