    "summary": "The crypto market is showing mixed signals today. Bitcoin is experiencing a slight pullback as altcoins gain favor, with the total market cap crossing the $2 trillion mark. Institutional interest remains a key driver, with JP Morgan highlighting reduced volatility as a catalyst for adoption, while Coinbase's strong Q1 earnings report points to robust retail participation. The hashrate hitting an all-time high suggests strong network health, but the shift towards altcoins and a slight dip in Bitcoin dominance indicate potential short-term rotation.",
