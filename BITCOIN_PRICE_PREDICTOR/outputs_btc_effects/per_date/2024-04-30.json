    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn today, falling below $60,000 and marking its worst monthly performance since November 2022. This decline is attributed to a combination of macroeconomic concerns, particularly around interest rates, and a disappointing debut for Hong Kong's spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. The arrest of 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver on tax evasion charges adds to regulatory uncertainty. Despite these short-term headwinds, long-term bullish sentiment remains supported by ongoing institutional adoption via ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin halving's supply shock.",
