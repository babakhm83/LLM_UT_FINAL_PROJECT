    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a volatile day, hitting new all-time highs above $73,000, largely driven by record inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, hotter-than-expected US CPI data caused a temporary pullback, raising concerns about potential delays in Fed rate cuts. Despite this, the overall sentiment remains bullish due to strong ETF demand and positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem with the Dencun upgrade. Regulatory news, such as proposed mining taxes, introduces some short-term bearish pressure.",
