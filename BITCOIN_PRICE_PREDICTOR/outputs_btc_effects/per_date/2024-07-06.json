Gox repayments and potential government selling, creating immediate bearish pressure. However, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw substantial inflows on Friday, indicating strong 'buy the dip' sentiment from institutional investors. Macroeconomic factors, including a dovish jobs report, are supporting record highs in stock markets, creating a positive risk-on environment that could offer some short-term support for Bitcoin.
