    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing a broad sell-off, with Bitcoin holding support above $40K but facing resistance at higher levels. Negative sentiment is driven by macroeconomic concerns like rising inflation and potential Fed rate hikes, as well as specific industry news such as regulatory calls to ban PoW mining and a widening discount on GBTC. However, positive developments like Intel's potential entry into mining hardware and Opera's crypto browser offer some long-term bullish undertones. The short-term outlook remains cautious due to the prevailing risk-off sentiment.",
