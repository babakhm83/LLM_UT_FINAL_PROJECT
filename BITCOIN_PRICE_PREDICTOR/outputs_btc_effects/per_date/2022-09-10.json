      "summary": "The US dollar index showed a slight recovery after a previous day's drop, following softer-than-expected US inflation data. The CPI rose 8.5% annually in July, flat month-over-month, which was below estimates. This data led some investors to adjust their expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
