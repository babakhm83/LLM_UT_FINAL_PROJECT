      "summary": "The article discusses how the Bitcoin price slump in early 2020 is impacting the geographical distribution of mining operations. With lower prices making older mining machines unprofitable, there's a shift in where mining is concentrated. Some miners, particularly those with less efficient hardware, are being forced to shut down, leading to a decrease in hashrate from certain regions. This trend suggests a potential consolidation of mining power towards more efficient operations and potentially more favorable energy cost locations.",
