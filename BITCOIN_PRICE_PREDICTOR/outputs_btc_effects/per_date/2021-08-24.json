The price resilience is attributed to improvements in the network's hash rate, despite earlier concerns about China's mining crackdown.

Regulatory developments remain a key focus, with the US infrastructure bill's crypto tax provision likely to pass, and Janet Yellen convening a meeting on stablecoins.
