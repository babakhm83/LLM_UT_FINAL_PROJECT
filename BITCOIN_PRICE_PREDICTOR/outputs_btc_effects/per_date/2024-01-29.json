While large Bitcoin investors ('whales') continue to accumulate, suggesting underlying strength, outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) persist, albeit at a slowing pace. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has spurred significant institutional interest and trading volume, with firms engaging in sophisticated arbitrage strategies. However, early ETF performance has been volatile, and fee competition among issuers is intensifying. Analysts are watching key price levels like $43,000 for Bitcoin, with a break above potentially signaling renewed bullish momentum. The broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a focus on institutional adoption and regulatory developments.",
