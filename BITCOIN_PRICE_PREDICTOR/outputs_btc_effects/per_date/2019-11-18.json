However, longer-term bullish catalysts remain, including institutional interest via Bakkt and ETF filings, and growing retail adoption through platforms like Square. Regulatory scrutiny on Bitcoin ATMs presents a short-term headwind, while positive developments in mining infrastructure and ecosystem funding offer underlying support.",
