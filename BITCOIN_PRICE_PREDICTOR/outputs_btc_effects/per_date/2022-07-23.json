      "summary": "This article discusses growth stocks trading at a discount due to market correction and revised estimates. While acknowledging the preference for blue-chip stocks amid inflation and recession fears, it suggests that discounted growth stocks could outperform once market sentiment reverses. This implies that while the broader market sentiment remains cautious, there's an opportunity for selective buying in undervalued growth sectors, which could include crypto-related assets if they are viewed through a similar lens.",

      "summary": "The article advocates for buying stocks during market turmoil when prices are low, suggesting that now is the time to look for deals. It highlights that many quality stocks are at their lowest levels since 2008-09. The strategy of buying at regular intervals during price declines is recommended to secure the best prices. This sentiment aligns with a 'buy the dip' mentality, which is often applied to cryptocurrencies, suggesting that current market conditions might be attractive for accumulation.",

Retail investor sentiment, as indicated by a BofA survey, also shows a strong intent to buy, suggesting underlying demand despite macro headwinds.
