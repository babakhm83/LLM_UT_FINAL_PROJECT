    "summary": "The market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the S&P 500 showing continued buying pressure and a general risk-on appetite despite geopolitical concerns. Energy markets are also bullish, with rising oil prices driven by supply concerns and potential production agreements. However, traditional safe-haven assets like gold are showing weakness, suggesting a potential rotation away from these assets. In the crypto space, regulatory actions in Quebec and Zimbabwe, along with critical commentary from figures like Charlie Munger, present bearish headwinds, while early institutional adoption by universities and increased merchant processing offer some bullish signals.",
