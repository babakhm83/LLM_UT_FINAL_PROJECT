    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing significant downward pressure today, with Bitcoin plunging and major financial institutions like Bank of America and Barclays issuing bearish calls, labeling the market a 'bubble.' Ethereum is also underperforming, failing to hold gains. This broad negative sentiment, driven by institutional analysis and technical breakdowns, suggests a high probability of continued price declines in the short term. Regulatory concerns from China and US sanctions also contribute to the bearish outlook.",
