      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dalio-bitcoin-good-probability-outlawed-124304454.html",
      "summary": "Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, believes there's a 'good probability' the US government could outlaw Bitcoin, similar to how gold was regulated in the 1930s. He argues governments may not want Bitcoin to compete with their control over money and credit. While acknowledging Bitcoin's proven track record, Dalio's warning highlights potential regulatory risks.",

However, strong long-term holder conviction and increased exchange outflows suggest underlying resilience.

Conversely, warnings from Ray Dalio about potential government crackdowns and regulatory scrutiny in India add a layer of uncertainty.",
