Gox creditor distributions and significant outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, which recorded $81 million in net outflows.

Despite the short-term selling pressure, institutional adoption continues to be a strong underlying theme, with major banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs revealing substantial Q2 investments in Bitcoin ETFs, signaling ongoing conviction.
