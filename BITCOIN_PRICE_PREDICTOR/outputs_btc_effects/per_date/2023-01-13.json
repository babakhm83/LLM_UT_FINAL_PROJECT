      "summary": "Grayscale has filed a reply brief in its legal battle with the SEC, calling the regulator's argument for blocking a Bitcoin spot ETF 'illogical.' This filing is part of ongoing litigation initiated after the SEC denied Grayscale's conversion of its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The core of the dispute lies in the SEC's assertion that the ETF application did not adequately protect investors.",

      "summary": "Bitcoin has rebounded above $18,000, and Ether has seen gains exceeding 13% over the past week. This positive performance is attributed partly to the rally in traditional equity markets, which has provided tailwinds for cryptocurrencies.
