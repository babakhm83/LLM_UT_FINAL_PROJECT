    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a slight pullback on Saturday, failing to hold above key resistance levels, indicating short-term bearish pressure. However, the long-term outlook remains bullish, driven by the anticipation of the May halving event, which is expected to reduce supply and drive prices higher. Geopolitical tensions continue to support Bitcoin as a potential safe-haven asset, correlating with gold's performance. Regulatory developments, such as France's first ICO approval, signal a move towards clearer frameworks, while ongoing legal scrutiny of major players like Tether and Bitfinex introduces lingering uncertainty.",
