However, regulatory headwinds persist, with Google banning crypto ads and Ripple urging stricter UK regulations. Mining infrastructure continues to expand with Bitmain's US operations, but the ongoing debate about energy consumption remains a long-term concern. Overall, the short-term outlook is cautiously optimistic due to potential institutional inflows, but regulatory developments and market sentiment will be key.",
