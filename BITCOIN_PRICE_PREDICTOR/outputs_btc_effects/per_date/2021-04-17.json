    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable pullback on Friday, falling nearly 3% and breaking key support levels, driven partly by retail traders taking profits while larger holders may have been selling. Despite this short-term bearish movement, on-chain data suggests the overall bull trend remains intact, with long-term holders showing conviction. The market is also digesting the implications of Coinbase's IPO and the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, as evidenced by Bitcoin surpassing Facebook in market cap. However, concerns about Bitcoin's valuation and potential regulatory headwinds persist.",
