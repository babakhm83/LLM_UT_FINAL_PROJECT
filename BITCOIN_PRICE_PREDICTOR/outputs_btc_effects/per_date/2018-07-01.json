On the long-term front, Intel's planned entry into the discrete GPU market and continued strength in Nvidia's hardware business suggest evolving infrastructure that could indirectly support crypto. However, investor sentiment appears cautious, with articles suggesting traditional stocks are a safer bet than Bitcoin, and a federal probe into crypto manipulation is creating regulatory uncertainty. Short-term, potential disruptions to mining operations in Sichuan due to floods pose a bearish risk to hashrate and network stability. Conversely, growing merchant adoption of Bitcoin and strategic shifts by fintech firms like Circle signal potential for increased utility and positive sentiment, offering a bullish counterpoint. Macroeconomic concerns, including China's bear market and trade tensions, contribute to a general risk-off environment, potentially pressuring Bitcoin.",
