    "summary": "The crypto market is dominated by the fallout from the FTX collapse, triggering widespread fear and significant outflows from exchanges. This 'crypto bank run' and the ensuing 'cascading contagion' fears are creating extreme bearish sentiment. Regulatory scrutiny is expected to intensify, with politicians and industry figures calling for stricter oversight. Miner profitability is also under pressure due to falling Bitcoin prices. While some traditional markets show resilience and the dollar is mixed, the immediate outlook for crypto remains highly negative due to systemic risk and loss of confidence.",
