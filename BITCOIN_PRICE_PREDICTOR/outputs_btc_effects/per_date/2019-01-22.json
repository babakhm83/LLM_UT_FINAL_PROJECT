      "summary": "Ethereum's on-chain transaction volume reached an all-time high in December 2018, excluding activity from the DAO hack. Transaction counts remained stable between 16-17 million monthly. This indicates strong network activity and utility for Ethereum, which could indirectly benefit the broader crypto market by demonstrating the viability of smart contract platforms.",

    "summary": "The market is showing mixed signals. Long-term, institutional interest is growing with news of Nasdaq's planned Bitcoin futures and the upcoming launch of the tZERO security token platform, suggesting potential for increased adoption and liquidity. However, regulatory headwinds persist, with Japan rejecting crypto ETFs and a senior Bank of England advisor criticizing digital assets. Short-term, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating, with some analysts predicting a period of low volatility. However, its correlation with the VIX indicates it remains a risk asset, vulnerable to broader market downturns. Negative sentiment from regulatory actions and exchange scandals in Korea are also weighing on the market.",
