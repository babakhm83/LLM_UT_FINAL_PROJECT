Macroeconomic factors, including the Fed's rate hike and ongoing tech sector weakness, add to a mixed short-term outlook. Long-term, institutional interest is growing with the approval of Canada's first blockchain ETF, but major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs are issuing strong warnings about crypto market bubbles.",
