This aligns with a broader trend of improving sentiment in traditional markets, with the Nasdaq posting its best win streak in months. Long-term, the anticipation of cooling inflation and potential Fed easing remains a key bullish driver. However, concerns about a US CBDC potentially crowding out crypto and warnings of a 'bull trap' in the short term suggest caution.",
