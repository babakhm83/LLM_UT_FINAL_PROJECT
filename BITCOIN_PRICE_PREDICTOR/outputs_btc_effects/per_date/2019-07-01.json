    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a sharp correction on Sunday, falling over 18% and undoing some of its recent gains, amplified by typical weekend volatility. Technical indicators suggest further downside risk, with potential pullbacks below $10,000. However, long-term catalysts like the upcoming Bakkt launch and increasing institutional interest remain positive. Regulatory developments in Brazil and institutional adoption news from Microsoft provide a mixed but generally constructive long-term outlook, while short-term sentiment is bearish due to the recent price drop and technical signals.",
