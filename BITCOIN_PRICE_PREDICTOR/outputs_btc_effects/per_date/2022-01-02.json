However, macroeconomic factors like potential Fed tapering pose a bearish threat. Short-term, the all-time high hash rate is a strong bullish indicator for network health. Conversely, predictions of meme coin decline and ongoing scam risks introduce cautionary notes. Overall, the market appears cautiously optimistic with underlying macroeconomic headwinds.",
