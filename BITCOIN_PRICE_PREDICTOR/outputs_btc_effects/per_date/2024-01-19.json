While institutional adoption via ETFs continues to show strong inflows (e.g., IBIT), Bitcoin's price has pulled back from recent highs, suggesting a 'sell-the-news' event or profit-taking. Macroeconomic data, particularly concerning inflation and interest rate expectations in the UK and US, is influencing broader market sentiment, creating a degree of uncertainty.
