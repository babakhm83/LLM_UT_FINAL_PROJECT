The potential launch of a blockchain ETF in China and Huobi Indonesia's fiat gateway are positive for adoption and liquidity. However, regulatory actions in South Korea and Uzbekistan, along with thin market conditions, introduce short-term uncertainty. The long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic due to institutional interest and growing adoption in Asia, despite some mining sector headwinds.",
