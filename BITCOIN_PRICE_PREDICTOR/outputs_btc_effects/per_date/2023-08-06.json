      "summary": "Elon Musk has definitively stated that Twitter (X) will not launch its own crypto token. This statement directly addresses years of speculation, particularly within the Dogecoin community. The clear denial removes a potential catalyst for speculative interest in a hypothetical X token, and by extension, could temper some of the hype around Dogecoin's integration with the platform.",

    "summary": "The long-term outlook remains bullish, primarily driven by sustained institutional interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs, with analysts increasing approval odds. MicroStrategy's positive outlook and filings from TradFi giants like Direxion further support this sentiment. In the short term, Elon Musk's denial of a Twitter crypto token launch has minimal impact. However, unconfirmed rumors of SBF executing a rug pull on Coinbase's Base L2 could introduce minor bearish sentiment. Overall, the market appears to be consolidating, with long-term institutional catalysts outweighing short-term speculative noise.",
