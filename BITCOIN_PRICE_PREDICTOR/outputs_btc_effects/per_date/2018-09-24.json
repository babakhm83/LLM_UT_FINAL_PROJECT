However, positive developments include Dubai launching a blockchain payment system and a new study challenging Tether's price manipulation claims, offering some underlying support. Meanwhile, advancements in mining hardware efficiency and improved KYC processes signal ongoing infrastructure development. The market remains sensitive to regulatory news, as highlighted by a BIS report, and institutional interest, though cautious, is evident with initiatives like Canadian Bitcoin mutual funds and Bank of America's blockchain patent filings.",
