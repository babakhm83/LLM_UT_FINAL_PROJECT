    "summary": "The crypto market has seen significant positive momentum this week, largely driven by the U.S. government's intervention in the banking sector following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This has led to substantial rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Bitcoin up 36% and Ethereum up 27% over the past seven days. This suggests a potential flight to digital assets as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Long-term, the growth in digital asset custody and increasing adoption of Bitcoin for new use cases like NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain are positive indicators.",
