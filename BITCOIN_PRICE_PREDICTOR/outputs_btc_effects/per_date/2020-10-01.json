      "summary": "Ethereum miners earned a record $166 million in fees in September, significantly outpacing Bitcoin's $26 million. This surge is attributed to the booming DeFi sector driving high transaction volumes on Ethereum. The substantial fee revenue for ETH miners indicates strong network activity and demand for block space, which can be a bullish signal for ETH, but also points to potential scalability issues that could impact user experience and transaction costs in the short term.",

It argues that while forks create new assets, they haven't diluted Bitcoin's core value proposition or its scarcity. This perspective is generally bullish for Bitcoin's long-term narrative of being a scarce digital asset, suggesting that the network's resilience to forks reinforces its unique position in the market.",
