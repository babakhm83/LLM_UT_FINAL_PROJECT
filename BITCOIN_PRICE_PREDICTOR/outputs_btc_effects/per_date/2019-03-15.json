News of ransomware attacks involving Bitcoin, while not directly impacting price, can create negative sentiment. Long-term, institutional adoption signals like JPMorgan's JPM Coin and Nasdaq listing crypto indices remain strong bullish indicators, alongside positive commentary from tech leaders like Jack Dorsey and Tim Draper.",
