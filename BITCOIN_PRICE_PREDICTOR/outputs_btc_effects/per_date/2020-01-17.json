Geopolitical tensions continue to provide a bullish macro backdrop, while increased insurance coverage from Gemini enhances market security. However, the failure to hold key resistance levels and the retraction of a tax payment proposal in New Hampshire introduce some short-term bearish elements. Overall, the market is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on whether Bitcoin can sustain upward momentum.",
