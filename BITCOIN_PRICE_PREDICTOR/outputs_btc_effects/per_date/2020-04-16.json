      "summary": "The Libra Association is modifying its original plan for a global digital currency backed by a basket of currencies. Instead, it will focus on developing multiple stablecoins, each pegged to a single fiat currency, to address regulatory concerns. This revised model aims to gain approval from global regulators. While this change might limit Libra's initial ambitious scope, it could pave the way for a more regulated and potentially wider adoption of its stablecoin products, impacting the broader stablecoin market.",
