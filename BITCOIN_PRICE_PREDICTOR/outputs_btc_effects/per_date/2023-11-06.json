    "summary": "The crypto market is showing mixed signals today. Long-term, the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing institutional adoption, evidenced by Grayscale's indices and major banks offering custody services, remain strong bullish drivers. Macroeconomic factors like government spending are also cited as potential long-term catalysts. Short-term, positive operational updates from miners like HIVE Digital and optimistic price predictions from Bernstein provide some bullish undertones. However, a slight dip in Bit Digital's production and continued weakness in the NFT market (OpenSea layoffs) introduce minor bearish elements. Wall Street sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with recent market reversals suggesting potential for broader risk-on appetite.",
