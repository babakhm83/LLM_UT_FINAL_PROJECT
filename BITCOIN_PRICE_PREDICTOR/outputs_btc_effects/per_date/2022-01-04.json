    "summary": "Bitcoin is showing signs of consolidation, trading within a defined range, with key support levels being tested. While some altcoins are exhibiting strength, Bitcoin's struggle to break resistance suggests a cautious short-term outlook. Positive developments in institutional adoption and regulatory clarity in regions like India and Estonia provide long-term bullish signals. However, ongoing SEC delays on spot ETFs continue to be a regulatory headwind. The hashrate reaching an all-time high is a strong indicator of network health.",
