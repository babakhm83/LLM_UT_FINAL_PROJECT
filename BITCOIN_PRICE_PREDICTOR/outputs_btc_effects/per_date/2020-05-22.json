It highlights that the upcoming halving in May 2020 will reduce the block reward for miners, a built-in mechanism to control Bitcoin's inflation. The author, a researcher at ETH Zurich, suggests that financial models will play a role in how the price reacts post-halving, implying a potential for increased institutional interest and price discovery based on these models.",
