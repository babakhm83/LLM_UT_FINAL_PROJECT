    "summary": "The crypto market is showing signs of a short-term recovery, with Bitcoin trading around $6,600-$6,700, driven by positive news like Google lifting its crypto ad ban and Italy joining the European Blockchain Partnership. However, regulatory headwinds persist, with the SEC charging a forex broker for illegal Bitcoin-related swaps, and the shutdown of India's Zebpay exchange due to banking restrictions. An early miner is also quietly cashing out, adding subtle selling pressure. Overall sentiment is mixed, with technicals suggesting a potential breakout for Bitcoin.",
