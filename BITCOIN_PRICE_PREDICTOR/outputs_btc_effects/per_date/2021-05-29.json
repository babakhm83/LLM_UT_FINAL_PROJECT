This follows a period of heavy losses in May attributed to regulatory pressures. While some long-term bullish indicators remain, such as institutional adoption news from Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, and the continued narrative of Bitcoin as 'digital gold', the immediate short-term outlook is clouded by regulatory concerns (Biden's tax crackdown) and ongoing environmental impact discussions. The listing of VanEck's crypto ETPs in Europe offers a positive short-term catalyst for accessibility, but the prevailing price action suggests continued caution.",
