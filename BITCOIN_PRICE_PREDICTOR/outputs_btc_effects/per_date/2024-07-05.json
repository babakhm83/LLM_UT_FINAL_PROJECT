    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn today, dropping below $54,000, its lowest point since February. This sharp decline was primarily driven by the movement of large Bitcoin amounts from Mt. Gox wallets, signaling impending creditor repayments, and continued selling pressure from government wallets. The market saw substantial liquidations of bullish positions, pushing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to extreme lows. On the macro front, weaker U.S. jobs data provided some support for rate cut expectations, which could be a longer-term bullish factor, but the immediate impact of crypto-specific selling events is dominating price action.",
