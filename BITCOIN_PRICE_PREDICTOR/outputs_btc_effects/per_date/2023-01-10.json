While the overall crypto market cap has risen, it's still significantly down from the previous year. The subdued volatility suggests a period of consolidation before potential larger moves.",

Conversely, positive market reactions to Coinbase's cost-cutting and a narrowing discount for GBTC offer some bullish undertones.
