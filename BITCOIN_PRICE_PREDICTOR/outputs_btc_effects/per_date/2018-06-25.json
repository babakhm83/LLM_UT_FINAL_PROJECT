This risk-off environment is expected to put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, concerns about miner centralization due to Bitmain's increasing hashrate control are present, though their immediate price impact is uncertain. Institutional interest in blockchain, as evidenced by Facebook's exploration and past patent filings by major banks, continues to be a long-term bullish factor, but is overshadowed by immediate macro concerns.",
