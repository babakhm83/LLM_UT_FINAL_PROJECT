    "summary": "Bitcoin continues to show resilience, consolidating around the $90,000-$100,000 range after reaching new all-time highs. Positive sentiment stemming from political shifts, particularly the 'Trump trade,' and strong institutional inflows into ETFs remain key drivers. However, mixed signals from ETF flows and increased activity in inverse ETFs suggest potential short-term volatility.
