    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant and rapid price crash, losing approximately 20% of its value, dragging down the entire crypto market to 6-month lows for many altcoins. This sharp downturn, with no clear immediate cause, suggests strong bearish sentiment. However, positive developments like RSK acquiring Taringa and Harbor receiving a FINRA license offer glimmers of adoption and regulatory progress, while the fix for a critical Lightning Network bug bolsters infrastructure confidence. Macro factors remain mixed with trade deal uncertainty impacting traditional markets.",
