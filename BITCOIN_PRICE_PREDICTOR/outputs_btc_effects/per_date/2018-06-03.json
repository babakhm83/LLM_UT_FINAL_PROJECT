    "summary": "Bitcoin is showing signs of consolidation after a volatile period, trading sideways with minor gains. Positive developments include the potential for broader adoption through gaming rewards in Japan and the ongoing discussion of crypto as a payment alternative to traditional systems like Visa, especially after recent disruptions. However, macro factors like a strengthening dollar and rising yields are creating headwinds for safe-haven assets like gold, which could indirectly pressure riskier assets like Bitcoin. The long-term outlook remains influenced by institutional sentiment and technological integration into traditional industries.",
