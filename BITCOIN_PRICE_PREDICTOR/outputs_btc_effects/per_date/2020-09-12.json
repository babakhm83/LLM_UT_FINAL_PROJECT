While there's focus on macro events like the iPhone launch and broader economic trends, the crypto market is seeing some activity with daily summaries from platforms like ALT 5 Sigma providing liquidity data. The mention of the SUSHI token saga and the general 'holding pattern economy' suggests potential for short-term volatility, but no strong directional conviction is evident from these short-term signals.",
