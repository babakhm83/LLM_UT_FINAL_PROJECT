On the long-term front, the continued wave of institutional interest in ETFs, exemplified by Fidelity's potential filing and the surge in Ethereum ETF applications, remains a strong bullish indicator. However, ongoing regulatory pressures from the SEC, as seen with the Coinbase lawsuit and potential Binance charges, introduce significant short-term headwinds and uncertainty. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the Fed's stance on interest rates, also lean bearish for risk assets in the immediate term. The Litecoin halving's failure to ignite market sentiment further contributes to a cautious outlook.",
