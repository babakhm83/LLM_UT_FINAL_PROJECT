The long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, driven by the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs following the Grayscale court victory and positive developments in corporate accounting for digital assets. However, short-term sentiment is dampened by low trading volumes and a general market downturn in August. The filing of an Ether ETF by Ark Invest offers a potential catalyst, but its immediate impact is yet to be seen. Macroeconomic concerns regarding interest rates continue to weigh on broader market sentiment.",
