Political developments surrounding Donald Trump are providing some bullish momentum, but this is counteracted by persistent selling pressure and negative sentiment indicators. The SEC's decision to close an investigation into Stacks offers some regulatory clarity, while Robinhood's planned crypto futures expansion could boost liquidity.",
