      "summary": "Decentralized social app Damus has been given a two-week ultimatum by Apple to remove its Bitcoin tipping feature (zaps) or face removal from the App Store. The issue stems from Apple's requirement to use its in-app purchase system, which takes a 30% cut, conflicting with Damus's use of the Lightning Network for direct creator payments. This situation highlights the ongoing friction between centralized platforms and decentralized applications.",
