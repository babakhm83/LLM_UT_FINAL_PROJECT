    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced volatility following the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting, where interest rates were held steady but the forecast for rate cuts was reduced to one for 2024. This hawkish outlook initially pressured Bitcoin, causing a dip below $67k. However, cooler-than-expected inflation data and positive commentary from SEC Chair Gary Gensler regarding Ether ETF approvals provided some support. Political developments, with Donald Trump backing Bitcoin mining, offer a bullish tailwind for the mining sector. MicroStrategy's announcement of a $500 million convertible note offering to acquire more Bitcoin is a significant bullish signal for direct BTC demand.",
