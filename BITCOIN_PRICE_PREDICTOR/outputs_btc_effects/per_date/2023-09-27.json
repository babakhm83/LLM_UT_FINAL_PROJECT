The SEC's repeated delays on spot Bitcoin ETF applications for Ark and Global X, coupled with JPMorgan Chase UK restricting crypto transactions, add to short-term bearish sentiment and regulatory uncertainty. However, political pressure from House lawmakers to approve ETFs offers a glimmer of bullish hope.
