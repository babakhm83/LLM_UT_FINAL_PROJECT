    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a mixed day, trading within a range as markets awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision and President Biden's address. While some technical indicators suggested a potential short-term bullish continuation, resistance at $56,000 capped immediate gains. News of institutional adoption, such as Nexon's $100M Bitcoin purchase and expansion in mining hardware orders, provided underlying support. However, concerns over potential capital gains tax hikes and a strengthening dollar introduced a bearish undertone. The overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with key macro events likely to dictate short-term price action.",
