Long-term, institutional interest in Bitcoin infrastructure and regulated products continues to grow, with firms like Blockstream and Stone Ridge making significant moves. Predictions from traditional finance institutions about Bitcoin's future price, particularly around the halving, are bullish. However, short-term, macro concerns like US recession fears are currently favoring gold over Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, creating some bearish pressure. Geopolitical events in Hong Kong are driving increased Bitcoin trading volume, suggesting it's being used as an alternative asset. The launch of new crypto ETPs in Europe signals continued product innovation and institutional adoption.",
