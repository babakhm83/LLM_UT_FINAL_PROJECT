Long-term, the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving and the narrative of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset amidst global uncertainty are bullish indicators. Institutional developments like JPMorgan's potential merger and the launch of regulated exchanges with crypto cards suggest growing adoption. However, short-term, scam activity related to the pandemic and the sentencing of crypto thieves introduce minor bearish sentiment, though the overall impact is limited. The Opera browser's integration of Apple Pay for crypto purchases offers a positive short-term boost to accessibility.",
