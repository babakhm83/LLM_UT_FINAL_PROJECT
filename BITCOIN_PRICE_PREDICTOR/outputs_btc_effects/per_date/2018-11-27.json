    "summary": "The crypto market remains under pressure, with Bitcoin experiencing significant price drops and hitting year-long lows. Regulatory news is mixed, with the SEC Chairman clarifying Bitcoin's status as not a security, which is a positive signal, but French regulators are pushing back on crypto sales. Security concerns are also present with BitPay warning users about potential private key theft. The Bitcoin Cash fork has concluded, with BSV showing strength while the broader market struggles. Overall, bearish sentiment prevails, but institutional interest and regulatory clarity for Bitcoin itself offer some glimmers of hope.",
