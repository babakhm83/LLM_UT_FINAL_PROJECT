      "summary": "Bitcoin's mining hashrate has fallen to a 13-month low, primarily due to increased mining activity decline in China. The total hashrate is now at 101.9 TH/s, the lowest since June 2020. This decline in hashing power impacts the network's security and resistance to attacks. The Chinese ban on Bitcoin mining is the main driver, forcing miners to relocate or shut down operations, which could lead to short-term network instability and potentially affect transaction processing.",
