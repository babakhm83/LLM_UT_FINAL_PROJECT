This event, coupled with a general decline in altcoins and worsening investor sentiment, suggests a cautious short-term outlook. However, the market remains sensitive to narrative-driven events, and the launch of new institutional funds indicates continued interest in the crypto space. Long-term, the narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge amidst global stimulus and increasing adoption through accessible platforms like Opera and ATMs remains a key bullish driver.",
