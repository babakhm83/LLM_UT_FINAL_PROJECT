    "summary": "The crypto market is showing signs of a modest recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining ground following Federal Reserve Chair Powell's indication of a potential slowdown in rate hikes. China's easing of COVID-19 restrictions also contributed to a more positive risk sentiment. However, ongoing fallout from the FTX collapse continues to cast a shadow, with Genesis creditors hiring lawyers to avoid bankruptcy and Kraken announcing significant layoffs, highlighting persistent industry distress. Coinbase's decision to delist several altcoins due to low usage also points to market consolidation.",
