Positive sentiment is being bolstered by news that G20 leaders may delay regulatory action, offering a temporary reprieve from immediate crackdown fears. However, concerns about potential US regulatory actions stemming from the Petro ban and ongoing debates about Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative introduce lingering bearish pressures. Proxy stocks are also seeing gains, correlating with Bitcoin's recovery.",
