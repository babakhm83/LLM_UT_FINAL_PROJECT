    "summary": "Bitcoin is showing signs of consolidation, struggling to break key resistance levels around $3,700, which could lead to a short-term bearish move towards $3,400. However, positive macro sentiment from potential US-China trade deals and continued institutional interest, as evidenced by Grayscale's report and the filing of a new Bitcoin ETF, provide underlying bullish support. The launch of JPM Coin by JPMorgan Chase further signals institutional adoption of blockchain technology, albeit in a centralized manner.",
