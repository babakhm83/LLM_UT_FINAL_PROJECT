    "summary": "Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs, driven by strong inflows into spot ETFs and positive market sentiment. Institutional adoption continues with significant ETF inflows and corporate treasury additions (MicroStrategy). However, record open interest in futures suggests potential for increased volatility. Macroeconomic data, while slightly hotter than expected, has not deterred the bullish sentiment in broader markets, with tech stocks also hitting new highs. Cathie Wood's optimistic price targets and Coinbase's strategic debt offering add to the positive short-term outlook, though the high leverage in futures markets presents a notable risk.",
