    "summary": "The crypto market experienced a significant downturn today, primarily driven by the Federal Reserve's hawkish outlook on interest rates, signaling fewer cuts in 2025. This led to a strengthening dollar, a rise in Treasury yields, and a broad sell-off across risk assets, including Bitcoin, which dipped below $96,000. Major altcoins also saw substantial losses, with the CoinDesk 20 index plunging over 10%. Fed Chair Powell's comments further dampened sentiment by distancing the central bank from potential government Bitcoin reserves and highlighting the bank's inability to hold Bitcoin. While extreme volatility might suggest a local bottom, the immediate outlook remains bearish due to macro headwinds and reduced liquidity expectations.",
