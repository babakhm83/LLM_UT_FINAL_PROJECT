    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn today, plummeting to a five-month low around $7,500, driven by a sharp sell-off and large liquidations on derivatives exchanges. This decline was exacerbated by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony regarding Libra, where he expressed doubts about its future, highlighting ongoing regulatory concerns. While volatility is high, the low volatility period preceding the drop suggests a potential for a significant move, though the immediate outlook remains bearish due to the sharp price action and negative sentiment surrounding regulatory news.",
