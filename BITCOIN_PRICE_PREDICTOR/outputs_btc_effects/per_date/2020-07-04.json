      "summary": "Bitcoin's block reward was halved for the third time on May 11, 2020, reducing the reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per block. This event, which occurs approximately every four years, is designed to control inflation and reduce the supply of new bitcoins entering circulation. Historically, halvings have been followed by significant price increases due to the reduced supply meeting consistent or growing demand. The reduced block subsidy also impacts miner revenue, potentially leading to a decrease in hash rate if less efficient miners are forced offline.",

      "summary": "Following the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin's hash rate reportedly dropped by 16% as miner revenue decreased by 44%. This decline is attributed to older, less efficient mining equipment becoming unprofitable due to the reduced block subsidy. The shift suggests a consolidation among miners, with newer, more efficient hardware likely to dominate.
