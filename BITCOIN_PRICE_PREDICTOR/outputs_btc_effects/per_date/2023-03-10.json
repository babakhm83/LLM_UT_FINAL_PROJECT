    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing a severe downturn today, driven by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Silvergate Bank, which has triggered widespread fears of banking sector instability and liquidity concerns. Bitcoin has fallen below the critical $20,000 level, with Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies also seeing significant price drops. This broad risk-off sentiment is overshadowing any positive news, such as Ark Invest's substantial purchase of Coinbase shares or updates on mining company mergers. The immediate outlook remains bearish due to these systemic financial risks.",
