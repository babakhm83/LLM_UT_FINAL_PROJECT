      "summary": "Bitcoin is trading around $51,000 and approaching the upper boundary of a three-year price channel, suggesting potential resistance around $60,000. Analysis of chart patterns indicates that the bull run might be showing signs of exhaustion. A flattening 50-week volume-weighted moving average (VWMA) could signal a slowing long-term uptrend, similar to patterns observed in 2018. This technical outlook suggests a potential near-term consolidation or pullback.",
