This macro backdrop is a headwind for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, ongoing positive developments in the ETF space, such as continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and the potential for Ethereum ETFs, provide underlying support. The narrative around Bitcoin's post-halving supply crunch and institutional adoption remains a strong long-term bullish factor.",
