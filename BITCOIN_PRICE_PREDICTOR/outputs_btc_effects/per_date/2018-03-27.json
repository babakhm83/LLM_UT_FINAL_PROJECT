Rallies are expected to attract sellers, and a break above $10,000 is needed for buyers to regain control. This indicates a bearish short-term outlook based on current price action.",

    "summary": "The market sentiment remains predominantly bearish, with significant declines observed in major stock indices, particularly in the tech sector. This risk-off environment is likely to weigh on Bitcoin. Furthermore, the increasing crackdown on crypto advertising by major platforms like Twitter, following similar actions by Google and Facebook, signals a tightening regulatory and marketing landscape. Technical indicators for Bitcoin also suggest further downside potential in the short term, with key support levels being tested.",
