This indicates resilience in the face of corporate selling.",

      "summary": "Bitcoin surged above its 50-Day Moving Average (DMA) near $23,000 and is targeting $24,000, supported by positive macro sentiment. Ethereum's rally has slowed, but the 'Merge' optimism keeps bulls targeting $1,700. Cardano is outperforming due to its upcoming Vasil hardfork.

Tesla's significant sale of Bitcoin holdings introduced some selling pressure, but the market demonstrated an ability to absorb it, leading to a rebound. Regulatory developments, such as the EU's MiCA directive, continue to provide a framework for long-term institutional adoption, while macroeconomic factors like Fed rate hikes remain a significant bearish overhang.",
