      "summary": "Despite Bitcoin's rally to near $16,000, Google search data indicates that popular interest and Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) among retail investors remain at normal levels. Google Trends shows a search interest value of 10, significantly lower than the peak during the 2017 bull run. This suggests the current rally is driven more by institutional or sophisticated investors rather than widespread retail exuberance, potentially indicating a more sustainable growth phase.",

However, some ETH outflows from DeFi and a lack of widespread retail FOMO suggest potential short-term consolidation. Regulatory developments, like the proposed U.S. bill for crypto exchanges, offer long-term clarity.",
