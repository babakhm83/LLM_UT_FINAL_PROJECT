However, Elon Musk's renewed conditional support for Tesla accepting Bitcoin, tied to mining's energy usage, provided a bullish catalyst, driving a price surge. Meanwhile, regulatory actions in China's Yunnan province against illegal mining introduce a bearish element of uncertainty. On the positive side, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF's record holdings suggest strong investor accumulation, and Jack Dorsey's endorsement of Bitcoin adoption in Nigeria adds to positive sentiment.",
