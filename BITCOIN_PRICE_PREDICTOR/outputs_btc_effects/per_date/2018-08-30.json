Technically, Bitcoin has broken key support levels, indicating short-term weakness. However, positive developments like the launch of Submarine Swaps for the Lightning Network and significant VC investment in Dfinity by Andreessen Horowitz offer potential bullish catalysts. The ongoing debate around Tether's backing adds an element of uncertainty. Overall, the short-term outlook is cautiously bearish due to regulatory headwinds and technical breakdowns, while long-term prospects remain supported by institutional interest and infrastructure development.",
