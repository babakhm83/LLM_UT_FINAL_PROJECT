      "summary": "JPMorgan analysts noted Bitcoin's resilience and correlation with traditional assets during March's financial meltdown. They also found liquidity on major Bitcoin exchanges to be more resilient than equities or gold. This analysis suggests Bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a traditional asset but with potentially better liquidity during crises, which could attract more risk-averse investors.",

However, the options market suggests this could be a bear trap, while strong inactive supply indicates long-term holder conviction.
