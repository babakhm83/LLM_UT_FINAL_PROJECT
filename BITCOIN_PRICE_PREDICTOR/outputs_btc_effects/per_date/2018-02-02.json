The market cap has halved from its January peak, indicating extreme bearish sentiment. Some speculative 'blockchain' companies are also retracting plans, adding to the negative sentiment. Despite some positive long-term infrastructure developments like Google's cable investments and the introduction of Bitcoin futures, the immediate outlook remains heavily bearish due to regulatory uncertainty and market panic.",
