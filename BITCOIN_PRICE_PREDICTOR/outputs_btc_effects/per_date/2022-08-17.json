      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-wrap-bitcoin-ether-prices-212658855.html",
      "summary": "Bitcoin and Ether have fallen for four consecutive days, with Bitcoin dropping 6% since briefly crossing $25,000 and Ether down 8% from $2,000. This trend indicates a short-term bearish momentum in the market. The continued decline suggests that recent price gains may have been unsustainable, and the market is consolidating or correcting downwards.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin and Ether are experiencing a short-term downturn, falling for the fourth consecutive day, influenced by the release of Federal Reserve minutes indicating continued rate hikes and concerns about stablecoin risks. This macro-economic backdrop is creating a risk-off sentiment in financial markets. Meanwhile, meme coins are showing resilience, but analysts view this as a potential contrarian signal. Institutional interest remains, with Coinbase expected to benefit from the Ethereum Merge, but overall market sentiment is leaning bearish in the immediate term.",
