      "summary": "Messari, a crypto data firm, suggests that Ethereum Classic's (ETC) recent rally, driven by miners seeking alternatives to Ethereum's upcoming 'Merge,' may not be sustainable. ETC is an offshoot of Ethereum and is not transitioning to proof-of-stake. Miners are attracted to ETC's continued proof-of-work mechanism, but Messari believes this interest might be temporary.",
