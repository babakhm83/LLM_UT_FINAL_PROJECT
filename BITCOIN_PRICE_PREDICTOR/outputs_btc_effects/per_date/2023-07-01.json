    "summary": "The crypto market closed Q2 on a positive note, with Bitcoin showing stability around $30,300 while Ether saw gains. Traditional markets also performed strongly, particularly tech stocks, driven by AI enthusiasm, which often correlates with positive sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin. However, ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the SEC on major exchanges like Coinbase introduces uncertainty. The news of BlackRock filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF remains a significant long-term bullish signal, while Tether's commitment to buying Bitcoin with profits adds consistent demand.",
