    "summary": "Bitcoin has decisively broken the $50,000 resistance level, reaching its highest point since late 2021. This surge is primarily driven by sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have now accumulated $10 billion in AUM within three weeks. Positive sentiment is further bolstered by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and the upcoming Bitcoin halving. While some profit-taking is observed at higher levels, the overall trend remains strongly bullish, with analysts predicting further upside potential. The news of Franklin Templeton filing for an Ethereum ETF also adds to the positive sentiment across the broader crypto market.",
