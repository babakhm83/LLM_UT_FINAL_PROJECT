      "summary": "Bitcoin and Ether traded steadily over the weekend, indicating a period of consolidation. While Luna saw significant gains, the broader crypto market remained relatively quiet. Technical analysis suggests that short-term buying for Bitcoin might be constrained by negative momentum on the weekly chart. This points to a potential lack of immediate upward catalysts and a possible continuation of sideways price action.",
