    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a dip, falling below $29,000, largely due to fears of DeFi contagion stemming from the Curve Finance hack. This has led to a risk-off sentiment across the crypto market, impacting altcoins significantly. Macroeconomic factors, such as the dollar index and Treasury yields, are also playing a role, overshadowing positive news like MicroStrategy's profitability and Binance's expansion into Japan. The low volatility environment suggests a potential for a sharp price move, but the immediate outlook remains bearish due to the DeFi exploit.",
