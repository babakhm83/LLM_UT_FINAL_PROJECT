However, a broader market risk-off sentiment emerged on October 28th due to COVID-19 lockdown fears, causing Bitcoin to slip below key technical indicators. JPMorgan's JPM Coin going live and Coinbase's upcoming debit card launch are positive long-term adoption signals, while miner profitability remains a short-term concern.",
