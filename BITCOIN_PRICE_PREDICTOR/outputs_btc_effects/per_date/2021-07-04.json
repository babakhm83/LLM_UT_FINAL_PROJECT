Long-term, El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and the growing trend of corporate treasury allocations are significant bullish catalysts. However, ESG concerns remain a factor for institutional adoption. Short-term, strong whale accumulation and positive price action on Saturday suggest bullish momentum, but the persistent 'Sunday effect' could introduce volatility.
