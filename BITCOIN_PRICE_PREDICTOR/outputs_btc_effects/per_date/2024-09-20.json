      "summary": "Following the Fed's rate cut, altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin and Ether, with a top 125 crypto index (excluding BTC/ETH) rising 5.7% while Bitcoin gained 4.4%. Experts attribute this divergence to altcoins' lower liquidity and higher beta, making them more sensitive to monetary policy shifts.

Bitcoin rallied strongly, liquidating short positions and nearing $64K, supported by a pause in BoJ rate hikes and increased BTC futures activity. MicroStrategy's substantial Bitcoin purchase further adds to positive demand. Regulatory approvals for Bitcoin ETF options on Nasdaq are also enhancing market infrastructure. However, a divergence showing altcoins outperforming Bitcoin suggests a short-term rotation into higher-beta assets, while dormant wallet movements introduce a note of caution regarding potential supply.",
