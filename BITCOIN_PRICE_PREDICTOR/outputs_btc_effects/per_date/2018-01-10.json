This is contrasted by continued 'blockchain hype' driving up stocks of companies like Kodak that announce crypto initiatives. Meanwhile, regulatory discussions are ongoing globally, with France calling for G20 talks, and US regulators hinting at more oversight. Bitcoin's price is under pressure, partly due to fears of Chinese mining crackdowns, while some altcoins like Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash are showing resilience.",
