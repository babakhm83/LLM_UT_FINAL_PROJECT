    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced significant volatility this week, reaching highs above $25,000 before retreating, but has shown resilience with a subsequent rally. Institutional interest is returning, with inflows into digital asset products, and the Fed's smaller rate hike is seen as a positive macro signal. The Ordinals protocol continues to drive activity and debate on the Bitcoin network, while the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, with some altcoins outperforming. The short-term outlook remains mixed due to ongoing volatility, but the longer-term trend appears cautiously optimistic driven by institutional adoption and a potentially easing macro environment.",
