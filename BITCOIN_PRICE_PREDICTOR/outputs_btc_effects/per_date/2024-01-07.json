      "summary": "Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick predicts Bitcoin could reach $120,000 by the end of 2024, a significant increase from their earlier $100,000 forecast. This upward revision is attributed to the expectation that Bitcoin miners will reduce their token sales. As miners become more profitable, they are likely to hold onto more of their mined Bitcoin, decreasing the available supply on the market. This reduced selling pressure, combined with other bullish factors, could drive the price higher than previously anticipated.",
