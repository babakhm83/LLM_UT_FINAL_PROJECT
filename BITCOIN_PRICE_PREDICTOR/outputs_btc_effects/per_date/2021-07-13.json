Bitcoin is weakening despite high US inflation, suggesting macro concerns like potential Fed tapering are overshadowing its inflation hedge narrative. On the regulatory front, Binance faces increasing scrutiny globally, and ICICI Bank in India is restricting crypto investments, both contributing to a cautious sentiment. However, positive developments include S&P Dow Jones launching new crypto indexes and Grayscale's GDLC fund becoming SEC-reporting, signaling growing institutional interest. Analysts predict a potential bullish breakout for Bitcoin from its current range, while exchange outflows suggest reduced selling pressure.",
