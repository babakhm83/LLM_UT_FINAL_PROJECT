Gox repayments and a broader tech sector sell-off led by Nvidia. Government entities moving significant BTC to exchanges also contributed to bearish sentiment. However, there are underlying bullish narratives, such as the potential for increased U.S. Bitcoin mining under a Trump administration and continued institutional interest in crypto ETFs, albeit with potentially lower demand for Ether ETFs compared to Bitcoin.
