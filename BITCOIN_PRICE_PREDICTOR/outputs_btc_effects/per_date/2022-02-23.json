Bitcoin is finding support despite geopolitical tensions, indicating resilience, but faces resistance at key technical levels, suggesting potential short-term consolidation.

The Terra ecosystem received a significant boost with a $1 billion reserve for UST, potentially stabilizing LUNA. However, derivatives data suggest Bitcoin may not be out of the woods yet, and a ransom demand in crypto highlights ongoing illicit use concerns.",
