China's underwhelming stimulus plans are creating a risk-off sentiment, while the ongoing debate about miner strategies and regulatory actions from entities like Crypto.com add layers of uncertainty. Despite these headwinds, institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs remains a long-term positive, though short-term price action appears range-bound.",
