Long-term, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and positive macroeconomic trends like anticipated rate cuts continue to provide a bullish backdrop, attracting significant institutional inflows. However, short-term sentiment is cautious, with investors digesting mixed economic data and the initial cooling of ETF hype.
