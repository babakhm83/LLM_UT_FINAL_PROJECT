    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable retreat below $9,000, reversing some of April's gains, with no clear catalyst. This price action, coupled with ongoing regulatory discussions and skepticism from traditional finance figures, suggests a cautious short-term outlook. Meanwhile, institutional interest in crypto is growing with new investment products, offering a potential long-term bullish signal, but immediate price action is dominated by bearish technicals and profit-taking.",
