This rally is occurring amidst mixed global economic signals, including a jump in US durable goods orders suggesting economic strength, but also concerns over escalating US-China trade tensions and rising Canadian inflation. Regulatory scrutiny remains a backdrop, with the SEC urging crypto exchange registration and the Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighting data privacy concerns, though these are not directly impacting Bitcoin's short-term price action.",
