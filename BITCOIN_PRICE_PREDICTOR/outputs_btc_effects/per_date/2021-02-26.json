This decline is largely attributed to a broader market sell-off in riskier assets, triggered by a rout in global bond markets and rising yields. While some institutional adoption news, like the continued interest from Wall Street and the growth in digital asset ETPs, remains a long-term bullish signal, the immediate macro environment is creating headwinds.
