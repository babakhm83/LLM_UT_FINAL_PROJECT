A key resistance at $7,800 was rejected, increasing the risk of a short-term downturn towards $6,500. Meanwhile, institutional developments like Fidelity's NYDFS charter continue to signal long-term adoption potential. However, a flash crash on Binance due to a failing stablecoin highlights short-term liquidity risks. The appointment of Bakkt's CEO to a senatorial role adds a political dimension, while news of increased Bitcoin money laundering difficulty is a net positive for the ecosystem's reputation.",
