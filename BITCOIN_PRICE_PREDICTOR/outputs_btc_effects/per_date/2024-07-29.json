    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant rally, briefly topping $71,000, primarily driven by Donald Trump's pro-crypto speech at Bitcoin 2024, where he pledged to make the U.S. a 'Bitcoin Superpower' and create a strategic reserve. This political endorsement has boosted market sentiment across cryptocurrencies. However, the U.S. government's movement of $2 billion in seized Bitcoin, potentially introducing selling pressure, has introduced some volatility. Senator Cynthia Lummis's proposed bill for a large government Bitcoin purchase further adds to the bullish narrative, while the 100-day mark post-halving aligns with historical bullish trends.",
