      "summary": "Bitcoin has slid for a third consecutive day, approaching $44,000 after reaching a three-month high near $46,800 earlier in the week. The price action is occurring amidst ongoing discussions among U.S. lawmakers regarding a crypto tax proposal. The lack of strong appetite for Bitcoin above $46,000, coupled with regulatory debates, suggests a short-term bearish sentiment.",
