    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a bearish weekend, falling from recent highs above $9,000 to around $7,900, a pullback of over 12%. Despite this, some analysts remain bullish, citing underlying strength and potential for further gains after a healthy correction. Long-term, institutional adoption continues to be a key driver, with Fidelity reportedly set to launch institutional trading soon. Meanwhile, major corporations like AT&T are integrating Bitcoin payments, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Regulatory news remains mixed, with the SEC offering some clarity on Ethereum while exchanges like Bittrex face U.S. restrictions.",
