    "summary": "The crypto market shows mixed signals today. Long-term, institutional adoption continues to be a strong theme, with Fidelity's potential entry into 401(k)s and Goldman Sachs' first Bitcoin-backed loan signaling growing mainstream acceptance. However, Robinhood's declining revenues and Morgan Stanley's caution on liquidity highlight potential headwinds for retail participation and speculative trading. Short-term, ApeCoin's surge ahead of its metaverse launch and the development of a Bitcoin bridge on Algorand point to positive sentiment in specific sectors, while Bitcoin's range-bound trading and weakening momentum suggest a cautious outlook.",
