    "summary": "The crypto market is showing mixed signals today. Long-term, institutional adoption through regulated products like Bakkt and CME options, alongside growing use cases in emerging markets, continues to be a bullish narrative. However, short-term indicators are leaning bearish, with a significant drop in Bitcoin's price and bearish technicals, alongside news of increased regulatory scrutiny and illicit activity busts. The falling dollar value of transactions also suggests a potential slowdown in on-chain usage.",
