      "summary": "Bitcoin futures volume on regulated platforms like CME and Bakkt saw a significant decline in March. CME's daily average volume dropped by over 50%, and Bakkt's fell by 38.7%. Open interest also decreased on both exchanges. This reduction in institutional trading activity suggests a cooling of interest or a pause in speculative activity, which could lead to lower volatility or a subdued market in the short term.",

However, long-term catalysts remain strong, with the impending halving and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin as an inflation hedge providing a bullish backdrop. Reduced institutional futures volume suggests a temporary cooling of speculative activity.",
