    "summary": "The crypto market is showing signs of stabilization and a potential short-term rally, primarily driven by positive sentiment surrounding the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes, which suggest a possible moderation in interest rate hikes. This has led to price increases across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, regulatory developments, such as New York's moratorium on certain crypto mining operations, introduce a bearish element. The ongoing impact of the FTX collapse continues to be a background concern, though immediate contagion fears appear to be easing.",
