This has led to price increases across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, regulatory developments, such as New York's moratorium on certain crypto mining operations, introduce a bearish element. The ongoing impact of the FTX collapse continues to be a background concern, though immediate contagion fears appear to be easing.",
