However, institutional interest is growing, with the NYSE expanding its crypto data feed, suggesting long-term bullish infrastructure development. Macroeconomic factors, including upcoming FOMC minutes and US economic data, are key drivers for short-term price action, with rising interest rates and a strong dollar posing a bearish headwind for Bitcoin. Altcoins are showing some strength, indicating potential short-term speculative interest.",
