    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing significant downward pressure today, largely driven by hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve regarding potential interest rate hikes. Bitcoin and Ether saw substantial liquidations, indicating heightened volatility and leveraged position unwinding. The SEC's rejection of Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF proposal further adds to regulatory headwinds. Despite these short-term bearish signals, some long-term adoption trends, like El Salvador's Bitcoin bond plans and institutional interest in crypto payments, remain positive.",
