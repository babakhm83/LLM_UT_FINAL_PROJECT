    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing a significant bullish surge today, primarily driven by a landmark court ruling that declared XRP not a security in certain contexts. This has boosted overall market sentiment, pushing Bitcoin above $31,000 and Ethereum past $2,000. Positive inflation data further supports a less hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, creating a favorable macro environment for risk assets. However, regulatory headwinds persist with lawsuits against Celsius Network and ongoing scrutiny of major exchanges like Binance, introducing some cautionary notes.",
