Positive sentiment from the Fed's decision and a rally in US stocks suggest a bullish short-term outlook. However, concerns about stalled rallies in both Bitcoin and traditional markets, coupled with ongoing FTX fallout and significant crypto hacks, introduce elements of caution. The introduction of the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin could also reshape the NFT landscape.",
