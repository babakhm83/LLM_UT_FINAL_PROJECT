      "summary": "Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein believes outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) are stabilizing. He suggests that selling pressure from bankrupt crypto firms is largely subsiding, and investors may be shifting from GBTC to newer, more competitive ETFs. This stabilization could signal a reduction in selling pressure on Bitcoin.",
