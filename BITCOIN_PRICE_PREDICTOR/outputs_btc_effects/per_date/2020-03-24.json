      "summary": "Open interest in Bitcoin perpetual contracts on BitMEX has fallen to a 18-month low, following a controversial long squeeze. Despite Bitcoin's price rallying to $6,863 (a 77% gain from its March 12 low), traders have reduced their positions. This collapse in open interest suggests a deleveraging event and potentially reduced speculative activity in the derivatives market, which could lead to less volatility but also dampen upward momentum.",
