      "summary": "The crypto market showed little reaction to an HBO documentary naming Peter Todd as the Bitcoin creator, indicating the news was a market 'dud.' Traders are awaiting U.S. economic figures. Bitcoin remained largely unchanged, with minor drops in major tokens. This suggests that speculative narratives without concrete market impact have little short-term influence.",
