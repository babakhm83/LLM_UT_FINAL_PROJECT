    "summary": "The market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with Bitcoin hovering around key levels. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates, continue to be a dominant influence. While some Fed officials are tempering rate cut expectations, the overall dovish tilt from the previous day's FOMC meeting is still providing some support. The ongoing anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval remains a significant long-term driver, with recent news of meetings between BlackRock and the SEC adding to this sentiment. Short-term price action may see volatility based on Fed commentary and broader market movements.",
