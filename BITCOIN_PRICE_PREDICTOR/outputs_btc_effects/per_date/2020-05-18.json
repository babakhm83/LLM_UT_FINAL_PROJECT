This event, which happens approximately every four years, is a fundamental mechanism designed to control Bitcoin's supply and is often cited as a bullish catalyst due to its deflationary nature. The halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, potentially increasing scarcity and, by extension, price if demand remains constant or increases.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin showed strong upward momentum over the weekend, breaking key resistance levels and ending the week with significant gains. This technical strength, coupled with ongoing narratives around Bitcoin as an inflation hedge amidst global stimulus, suggests a bullish short-term outlook. Institutional adoption signals, like the Italian bank's BTC trading and Square's involvement in stimulus programs, continue to provide long-term support. Meanwhile, increased stablecoin activity is boosting Ethereum's network usage, indicating broader ecosystem growth.",
