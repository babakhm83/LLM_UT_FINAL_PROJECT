Significant layoffs at major Chinese crypto firms like Huobi and Bitmain signal industry contraction and negative sentiment. The Lightning Network shows strong growth, but this is not yet translating into price appreciation. Bitcoin is struggling to hold key support levels, and a general post-holiday downturn suggests continued bearish momentum in the short term. Long-term, institutional interest via Nasdaq futures and exchange funding offers a glimmer of optimism, but regulatory uncertainty and bearish commentary persist.",
