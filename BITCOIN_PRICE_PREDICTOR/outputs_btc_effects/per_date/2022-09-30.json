      "summary": "Bitcoin is on track for its sixth consecutive monthly loss in September, a historically weak month for the asset. However, some altcoins like Chainlink (LINK) and Uniswap (UNI) are showing resilience and managing gains. This divergence suggests selective strength within the altcoin market despite Bitcoin's weakness.",
