Christopher Giancarlo suggests that Bitcoin futures helped the cryptocurrency market achieve a more sustainable level, despite earlier research linking futures to the market's decline. This statement offers a more optimistic perspective on the impact of regulated derivatives. If the market is indeed moving towards sustainability due to futures, it could imply a less volatile and more predictable price environment, which is generally positive for adoption.",
