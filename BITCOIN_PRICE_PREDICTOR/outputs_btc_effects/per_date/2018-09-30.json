      "summary": "The US Dollar strengthened due to expectations of further Federal Reserve rate hikes and positive US economic data, alongside a weaker Euro. The Fed's recent rate hike to 2%-2.25% and indications of more to come suggest a tightening monetary policy. This macro environment typically leads to reduced risk appetite, potentially impacting speculative assets like Bitcoin.",

Long-term, the ongoing debate and progress around Bitcoin ETFs continue to be a significant factor for institutional adoption. Meanwhile, regulatory developments in India highlight the persistent challenges in achieving clear legal frameworks.
