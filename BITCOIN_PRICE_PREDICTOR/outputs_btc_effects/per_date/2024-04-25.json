    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable price correction, dropping below $64,000, driven by significant outflows from Grayscale's GBTC and a pause in inflows for other major ETFs. This ETF-related sentiment shift, coupled with weaker-than-expected US GDP data and persistent inflation concerns, has led to a broader market downturn. Regulatory headwinds for Ethereum ETFs also contribute to a bearish short-term outlook, though long-term institutional adoption trends remain positive with ongoing ETF inflows and potential integration by major financial players like Morgan Stanley.",
