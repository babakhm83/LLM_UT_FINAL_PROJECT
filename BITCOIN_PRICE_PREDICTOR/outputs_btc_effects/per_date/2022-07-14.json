      "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-mining-rig-prices-slump-210948067.html",
      "summary": "Prices for the latest generation of Bitcoin mining rigs have fallen to near two-year lows, with models like the Antminer S19 and S19 Pro trading around $20-$23 per terahash. This decline is attributed to the bear market and the financial distress of companies like Celsius. Lower rig prices could reduce the cost of entry for new miners and potentially increase the hash rate if demand picks up, but it also reflects the current profitability challenges in the mining sector.",
