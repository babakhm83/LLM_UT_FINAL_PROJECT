While Bitcoin ETFs continue to see inflows, the broader market sentiment has shifted to risk-off. Mining profitability also declined for the third consecutive month, potentially adding selling pressure. However, some corporate entities continue to accumulate Bitcoin, and retail inflows remain steady, hinting at underlying support.",
