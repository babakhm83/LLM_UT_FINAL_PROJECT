    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop on Thursday, falling below $7,000. However, Friday saw a rebound driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with Bitcoin, gold, and oil surging. This geopolitical event is acting as a primary catalyst, positioning Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. Meanwhile, regulatory scrutiny on ICOs continues, with the SEC investigating Telegram. Bitcoin Cash also showed strong performance with a nearly 14% surge.",
