    "summary": "The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn today, with Bitcoin and Ethereum plummeting by as much as 17% and 11% respectively. This sell-off occurred on the same day El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, but the implementation faced technical snags, including issues with the government's digital wallet and exchange outages. Major crypto-related stocks like Coinbase also fell amid these disruptions. The broad market weakness and technical issues suggest continued volatility and potential for further downside in the immediate short term.",
