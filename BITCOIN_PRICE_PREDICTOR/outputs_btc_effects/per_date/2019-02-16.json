Long-term, institutional adoption continues to be a key theme, with partnerships between traditional and crypto entities and the development of regulated financial products showing promise. However, regulatory hurdles and bearish predictions from major financial institutions like JPMorgan and the OECD's call for ICO regulation present headwinds. Short-term, sentiment is mixed, with some metrics suggesting Ether may be undervalued, while data breaches and isolated trading errors create minor negative noise.
