Geopolitical tensions from the US-China trade war are also seen as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. On the adoption front, AT&T's integration of crypto payments and news of Facebook potentially launching 'GlobalCoin' point towards increasing mainstream acceptance. However, concerns about potential US regulatory bans and the ongoing 'alt season' narrative suggest potential short-term volatility and rotation into other cryptocurrencies.",
