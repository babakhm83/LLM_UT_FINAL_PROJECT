This decline occurred despite some positive news like Coinbase listing Ethereum Classic and a rebound in Bitcoin's price later in the day.

Macroeconomic factors like rising inflation and discussions around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) add to the complex market environment, while tech sector news like Tesla layoffs also contributed to a cautious overall market sentiment.",
