      "summary": "Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range, experiencing low volatility due to holiday trading. However, it recently bounced back from a low of below $25,500, now holding above $26,000. Traditionally, Bitcoin's price correlates with the Nasdaq 100. The article suggests that despite recent dips, there's potential for a comeback, implying that current price action might be a temporary consolidation before an upward move, influenced by broader tech market performance.",
