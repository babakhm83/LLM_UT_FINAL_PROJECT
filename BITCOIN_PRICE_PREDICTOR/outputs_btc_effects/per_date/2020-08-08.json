Despite this short-term pullback, the long-term outlook remains bullish, supported by strong Q2 earnings from Square, regulatory clarity from the OCC allowing banks to hold Bitcoin, and a record monthly close in July. The narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge against a weakening dollar also persists, alongside growing institutional and millennial interest. Evidence suggesting a new bull market is emerging, with increased smallholder addresses.",
