Bitcoin experienced a modest recovery, gaining 12% in 72 hours, but traders remain cautious due to lingering bearish sentiment and potential for further drops towards $3,000. Macroeconomic factors like a weaker USD and speculation about the Fed's interest rate policy are providing some support. On the adoption front, Square's Cash App surpassing Coinbase as the top Bitcoin buying app and Gemini's listing of Bitcoin Cash are positive developments. However, industry headwinds are evident with Bitmain closing its Israeli operations due to market woes, indicating ongoing challenges for mining firms.",
