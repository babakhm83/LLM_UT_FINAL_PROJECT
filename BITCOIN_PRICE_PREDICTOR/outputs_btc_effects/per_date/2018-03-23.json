      "summary": "Google announced it will ban advertisements for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) starting in June 2018. This decision follows a similar move by Facebook earlier in the year. The ban is attributed to growing concerns about scams and misleading practices within the crypto sector. The news coincided with a more than 10% drop in Bitcoin's price, marking its lowest point in a month. This action by a major advertising platform significantly curtails a key channel for crypto projects to reach potential investors and users.",
