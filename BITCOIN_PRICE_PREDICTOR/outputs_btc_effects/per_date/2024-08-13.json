Gox distribution fears, but showed resilience with inflows into digital asset products. Political uncertainty surrounding the US election, particularly the rising odds of a Kamala Harris presidency, is creating bearish sentiment, with analysts suggesting a higher likelihood of a $5K price drop. Conversely, a historic low in Bitcoin held on exchanges signals strong hodling sentiment, potentially paving the way for a price spike.
