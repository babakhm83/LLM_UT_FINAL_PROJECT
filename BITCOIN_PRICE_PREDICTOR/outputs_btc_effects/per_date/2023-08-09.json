      "summary": "The animated series Futurama featured an episode that mocked crypto miners and referenced Bitcoin in a future setting. While this is a cultural commentary and not a direct market driver, such portrayals can influence public perception and awareness of cryptocurrencies. The humorous take on mining and Bitcoin's future volatility might subtly impact sentiment, though its direct price impact is likely minimal.",

The SEC's intent to appeal the Ripple ruling introduces regulatory uncertainty, while Coinbase's launch of its L2 network, Base, is a significant infrastructure development.
