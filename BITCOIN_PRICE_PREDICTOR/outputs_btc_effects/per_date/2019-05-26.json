This rally occurred despite recent volatility, such as the flash crash on May 17th, which raises concerns for potential ETF approvals. Institutional interest remains a key driver, with news of Bank Frick launching a crypto tracker and NYSE Arca filing for a Bitcoin trust. However, a reported double spend incident in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) introduces a bearish element for that specific altcoin. Overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with strong short-term price action but lingering regulatory uncertainties.",
