    "summary": "The market shows mixed signals today. Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day gain in five weeks, potentially testing $8.5K, indicating short-term bullishness. However, broader market sentiment remains cautious with some altcoins outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting capital rotation. Regulatory developments, like increased UK investigations and positive signals from New Zealand, continue to shape the long-term landscape. The correlation between gold and Bitcoin due to negative real interest rates presents a potential macro tailwind.",
