    "summary": "The crypto market is showing mixed signals today. Strong U.S. employment data on Friday led to a dip, but some analysts view this as a 'buy the dip' opportunity, especially with global interest rate cuts potentially on the horizon. Institutional inflows into Bitcoin and Ether ETFs remain robust, indicating sustained demand. However, AI-linked crypto tokens are underperforming following Apple's event. The market is cautiously awaiting key economic data and Fed commentary later this week.",
