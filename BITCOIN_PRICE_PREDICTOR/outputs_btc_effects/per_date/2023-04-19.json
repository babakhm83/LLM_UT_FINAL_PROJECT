      "summary": "Bitcoin miner Mawson Infrastructure is selling its Texas sites for $8.5 million to a Singapore fund. This move is part of Mawson's strategy to shed operational weight and focus on its Pennsylvania operations.

    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable price drop, falling below the $30,000 mark due to a large sell order on Binance and high UK inflation data, leading to over $250 million in liquidations. This price action, coupled with rising bond yields and broader market concerns about inflation, suggests a short-term bearish sentiment. However, Bitcoin's ability to hold above $30,000 indicates some resilience, while the increasing dormancy of Bitcoin supply and developments in DeFi integration offer long-term bullish signals. The market remains sensitive to macroeconomic data and exchange-specific events.",
