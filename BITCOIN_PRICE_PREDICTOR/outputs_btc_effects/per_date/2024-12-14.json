MicroStrategy's inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 is a major short-term catalyst, expected to drive passive ETF inflows into its stock, which is closely correlated with Bitcoin's price. While Bitcoin experienced a minor pullback and derivative liquidations, the overall trend remains upward, supported by continued corporate buying and strong ETF inflows. Long-term outlook is bolstered by increasing corporate treasury adoption and potential regulatory clarity.",
