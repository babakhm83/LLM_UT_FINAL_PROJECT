      "summary": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey publicly criticized Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's decision to steer the company away from corporate activism. Armstrong's stance, outlined in an open letter, promotes an 'apolitical culture' at Coinbase, leading to a memo offering severance to employees who disagree. This public disagreement between prominent tech leaders highlights differing views on corporate responsibility and activism within the crypto space. Such debates can influence public perception and potentially impact user trust and engagement with exchanges.",
