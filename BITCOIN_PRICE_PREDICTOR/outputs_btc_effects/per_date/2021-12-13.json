    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing a significant downturn today, with Bitcoin falling below $48,000 and approaching key technical support levels. This decline is largely driven by anticipation of the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting and potential hawkish policy decisions to combat inflation, leading to a broader risk-off sentiment. Major altcoins are underperforming Bitcoin, with Solana showing particular weakness. Crypto miner stocks are also slumping, reflecting the market's bearish sentiment. Regulatory news, such as Binance's withdrawal of its Singapore application, adds to the cautious outlook. However, long-term bullish catalysts like the Taproot upgrade and increasing institutional adoption through products like Tezos ETPs and BBVA's Ether support remain in play.",
