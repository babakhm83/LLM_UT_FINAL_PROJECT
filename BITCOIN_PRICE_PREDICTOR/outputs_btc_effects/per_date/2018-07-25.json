    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable surge, breaking above $8,500, driven by renewed optimism around potential ETF approvals and strong institutional trading volumes in futures markets. However, the SEC's decision to postpone ETF reviews until September introduces a significant near-term risk, potentially leading to price consolidation or a pullback. Meanwhile, positive regulatory signals from India regarding crypto payments and high-profile endorsements like Alexis Ohanian's price prediction contribute to a mixed but cautiously optimistic sentiment. The upcoming CME futures expiration also adds a layer of potential volatility.",
