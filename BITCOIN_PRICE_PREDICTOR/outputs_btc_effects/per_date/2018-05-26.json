      "summary": "Bitcoin slipped 1.58% on Friday, reversing Thursday's gain, to end the day at $7,456.8. It failed to reach resistance levels and fell to an intraday low of $7,318.2. The bears ruled the week, with Bitcoin falling 12.5% Monday through Friday. This indicates continued downward pressure and potential for further declines.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant bearish week, closing down 12.5% and showing continued downward pressure on Friday, falling to $7,456.8. This trend is supported by broader market signals, including a sharp sell-off in crude oil and weakness in commodity-linked currencies like the AUD and NZD, suggesting a 'risk-off' sentiment. While some positive corporate news emerged in retail and biotech, their impact on Bitcoin is likely minimal. The US Dollar Index showed mixed movements, influenced by the Euro and Yen, adding to macro uncertainty. Long-term, institutional adoption indicators like Circle's increased OTC minimums and positive regulatory news from Zimbabwe offer some bullish undercurrents, but the immediate outlook remains bearish.",
