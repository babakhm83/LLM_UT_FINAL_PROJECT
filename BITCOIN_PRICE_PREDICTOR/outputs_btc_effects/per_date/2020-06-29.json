    "summary": "Bitcoin is trading in a tight range, with low volatility, suggesting anticipation of a larger move. The resurgence of Bitcoin's correlation with equities indicates that macroeconomic sentiment will likely drive short-term price action. Positive developments include potential PayPal integration and increased retail interest, while DeFi exploits and the general lack of e-commerce adoption for Bitcoin remain concerns. The upcoming Kyber upgrade offers a specific catalyst for that ecosystem.",
