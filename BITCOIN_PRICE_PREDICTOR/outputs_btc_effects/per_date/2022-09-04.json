While there's a focus on improving Bitcoin's utility through Lightning Network development by MicroStrategy, the broader trend of summer market weakness suggests continued downward pressure. Regulatory developments, such as the potential for ETH to be classified as a security, pose long-term risks, while increased mining difficulty could pressure miners.
