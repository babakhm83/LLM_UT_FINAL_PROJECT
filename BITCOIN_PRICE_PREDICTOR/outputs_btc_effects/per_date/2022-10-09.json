    "summary": "The crypto market sentiment remains cautious, influenced by ongoing macroeconomic concerns and the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance on interest rates. While some positive developments like institutional interest in crypto and regulatory clarity in specific cases (e.g., XRP lawsuit) offer pockets of optimism, the broader market is still grappling with liquidity concerns and a general risk-off environment. Mining sector news shows some signs of stabilization, but overall, the short-term outlook is dominated by macro headwinds.",
