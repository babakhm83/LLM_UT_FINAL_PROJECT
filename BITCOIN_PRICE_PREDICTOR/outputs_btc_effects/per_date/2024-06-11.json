    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable price dip below $67,000 today, breaking a streak of inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs with $65 million in outflows, led by GBTC. This coincides with anticipation surrounding the upcoming US inflation data (CPI) and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, creating market uncertainty. While short-term holders' realized price shows bullish sentiment, the ETF outflows and macro event anticipation point to potential near-term volatility. The mining sector remains a focus with expansion news and positive analyst outlooks.",
