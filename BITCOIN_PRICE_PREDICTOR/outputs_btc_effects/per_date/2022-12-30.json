In crypto, Bitcoin and Ether saw minor gains, but overall market volume was low, indicating indecision. Institutional interest, however, is showing signs of life, with Cathie Wood's ARK Invest making significant purchases of Coinbase stock, and BlackRock providing a loan to a bankrupt Bitcoin miner.
