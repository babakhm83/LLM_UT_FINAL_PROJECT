Analysts are expressing bearish sentiment, citing high stock valuations and technical chart patterns. However, positive developments like Square's new Bitcoin platform and the continued migration of miners to the US offer some underlying bullish support for the long term. Retail interest appears to be waning, as indicated by Google Trends data.",
