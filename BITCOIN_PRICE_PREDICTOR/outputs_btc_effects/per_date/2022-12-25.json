Long-term sentiment is cautiously bearish due to ongoing macroeconomic pressures from Fed rate hikes and the lingering effects of major industry collapses like FTX. However, some institutional interest, like ARK Invest's continued buying, offers a glimmer of bullish potential. Short-term signals are mixed, with insider buying in a specific crypto-related stock providing a minor bullish cue, while warnings about crypto scams and negative sentiment from industry critiques lean bearish.
