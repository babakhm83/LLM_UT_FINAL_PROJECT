This decline is attributed to hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials, signaling further interest rate hikes, and a general risk-off sentiment in broader financial markets. Michael Burry's warning of an ongoing market crash, specifically mentioning crypto as an early victim, reinforces the bearish outlook. While there was a brief rebound above $19,000, analysts remain skeptical of its sustainability. On the positive side, mining companies like CleanSpark are acquiring hardware at discounted prices, indicating potential for future hashrate growth, and Swan Bitcoin's move into TradFi signals continued institutional interest in adoption.",
