The approval and subsequent trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to drive significant inflows into products from major players like Fidelity and BlackRock, indicating strong institutional interest. However, this is contrasted by outflows from GBTC and a general price dip across major cryptocurrencies, suggesting a 'sell the news' reaction and potential profit-taking. Concerns about market liquidity, highlighted by the 'Alameda Gap,' are contributing to ongoing Bitcoin volatility. Meanwhile, regulatory commentary from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce hints at a potentially smoother path for Ethereum ETFs, offering a bullish outlook for ETH.",
