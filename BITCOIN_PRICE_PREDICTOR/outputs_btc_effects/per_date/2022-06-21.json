      "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing a rally, with smaller altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. This suggests a potential shift in market dynamics, where risk appetite might be returning, albeit selectively. While Bitcoin is also seeing gains, the outperformance of altcoins could indicate a rotation into higher-risk, higher-reward assets. This trend might continue in the short term, leading to mixed performance across the crypto market.",
