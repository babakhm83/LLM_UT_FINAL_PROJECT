While some altcoins are experiencing short-term gains, overall market sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing regulatory concerns, particularly regarding South Korea. The US dollar weakness and mixed global markets could offer some support to riskier assets like Bitcoin, but the immediate outlook is uncertain. Institutional interest remains a long-term positive, with news of major funds investing in Bitcoin, but short-term price action is dominated by technical resistance and regulatory overhang.",
