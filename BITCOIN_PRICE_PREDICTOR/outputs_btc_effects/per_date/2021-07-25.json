    "summary": "Bitcoin showed signs of recovery, trading around $34,800, but with significantly low daily trading volume, indicating a potential lack of conviction behind the move. Key resistance at the 50-day EMA remains a critical short-term indicator. Meanwhile, Ethereum's upcoming 'London' upgrade is generating positive sentiment. However, ongoing regulatory scrutiny on major exchanges like Binance and predictions of further crackdowns in China present significant bearish headwinds. Institutional interest, exemplified by Square's Bitcoin strategy, continues to be a long-term bullish factor, but short-term price action is dominated by technical levels and regulatory uncertainty.",
