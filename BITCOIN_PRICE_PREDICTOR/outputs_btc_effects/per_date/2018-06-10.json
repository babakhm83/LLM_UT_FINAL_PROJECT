    "summary": "The crypto market is experiencing significant downward pressure, with Bitcoin plunging below $6,700 and altcoins following suit, largely driven by a hack at the South Korean exchange Coinrail. This event has amplified existing bearish sentiment, with reports highlighting Bitcoin Cash's breakdown of support levels and negative commentary from figures like Warren Buffett contributing to the negative outlook. However, there's a glimmer of optimism regarding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which could attract institutional capital if regulatory clarity is achieved.",
