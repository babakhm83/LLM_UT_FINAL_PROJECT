While the inflation news provided a brief lift, Bitcoin failed to sustain gains, indicating underlying selling pressure or a lack of strong conviction. The U.S. government's movement of $300M in Silk Road-linked Bitcoin also introduced potential short-term sell pressure. Meanwhile, institutional interest continues with Coinbase being named a \"surveillance partner\" for potential spot Bitcoin ETFs, boosting its stock and signaling positive sentiment for regulated crypto products.
