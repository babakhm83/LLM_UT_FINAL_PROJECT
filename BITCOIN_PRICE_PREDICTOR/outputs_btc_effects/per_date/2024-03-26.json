The upcoming Bitcoin halving remains a key bullish catalyst, with prominent figures like Robert Kiyosaki expressing strong positive sentiment and planned purchases. However, regulatory actions, such as the DOJ's charges against KuCoin, introduce bearish pressure and potential market volatility. The London Stock Exchange's planned launch of crypto ETNs and Hong Kong's potential approval of in-kind ETF creations offer further bullish catalysts by expanding accessibility.
