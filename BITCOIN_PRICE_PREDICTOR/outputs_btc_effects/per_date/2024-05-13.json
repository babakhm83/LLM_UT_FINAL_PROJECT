Fewer new mints and wallet interactions are being recorded, and daily fees have declined from their initial highs.

    "summary": "Bitcoin is showing signs of consolidation, failing to hold key resistance levels around $63K-$64K, with declining transaction volumes suggesting a range-bound market. Upcoming inflation data is a major macro hurdle that could introduce volatility. While long-term prospects remain bullish due to ETF adoption and halving effects, short-term sentiment is cautious, with potential downside if key support levels break. Developments in Bitcoin's utility, like stablecoin integration via Lightning Labs, offer a positive counterpoint.",
