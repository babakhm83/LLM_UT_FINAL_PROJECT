    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable decline on Friday, reversing earlier gains and falling below key support levels, indicating short-term bearish pressure. However, on-chain data suggests underlying investor accumulation and a deepening supply shock, which could provide support.  Long-term, institutional adoption continues with Fidelity's investment in Marathon Digital and growing interest in green mining solutions. Meanwhile, El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and other countries considering similar moves represent significant macro adoption trends. The Cardano Alonzo upgrade also promises increased programmability, potentially boosting its DeFi standing.",
