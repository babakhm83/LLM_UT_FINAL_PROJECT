    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn, falling below key support levels like $58,000 and $57,000, marking its worst monthly performance in April since late 2022. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors including rising ETF outflows, decreasing US liquidity, and profit-taking ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Fed held rates steady, signaling no imminent cuts due to persistent inflation, which reinforces a bearish macro environment. Prominent crypto figures facing legal issues and regulatory scrutiny on major fintech firms add to the short-term bearish sentiment. Despite these immediate headwinds, long-term bullish narratives remain, with some analysts maintaining high price targets for the year.",
