With a nearly 100% gain year-to-date, Bitcoin has outperformed most assets in 2019. Greenspan suggests that despite the recent rally, the cryptocurrency is only at the beginning of a larger cycle that could lead to new highs. This optimistic outlook from a prominent analyst could influence short-term trading sentiment.",
