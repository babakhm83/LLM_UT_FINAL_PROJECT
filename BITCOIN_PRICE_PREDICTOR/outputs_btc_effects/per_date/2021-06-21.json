      "summary": "Bitcoin tumbled to a two-week low of $31,333 due to China's expanding crackdown on bitcoin mining, causing uncertainty among investors. The cryptocurrency has lost over 20% in the past six days and is now at half its April peak. The 'death cross' formation also suggests a bearish outlook.

    "summary": "Bitcoin and the broader crypto market experienced a significant downturn today, primarily driven by China's intensified crackdown on cryptocurrency mining and trading. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) directed financial institutions to cease crypto-related services, leading to sharp price drops and substantial liquidations. Technical indicators like the 'death cross' also signal further bearish sentiment in the short term. Despite this, long-term institutional adoption signals, like JPMorgan's potential Bitcoin fund, and nation-state adoption possibilities (El Salvador) remain positive underlying factors.",
