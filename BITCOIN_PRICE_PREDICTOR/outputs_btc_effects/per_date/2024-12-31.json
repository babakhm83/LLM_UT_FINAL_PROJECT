The digital asset is trading around $94,000, significantly below its mid-December record high.

While Bitcoin has seen significant gains throughout the year, driven by ETF approvals and 'Trump euphoria,' recent news suggests this rally is losing steam as the year ends. MicroStrategy's sharp price correction after its Nasdaq-100 inclusion highlights short-term volatility. Macroeconomic factors, including potential Fed rate cut adjustments and political shifts under a 'Trump 2.0' administration, are creating uncertainty. However, significant institutional accumulation, like Tether's large Bitcoin purchase, provides underlying support. The focus remains on how these macro and political narratives will shape asset flows into the new year.",
