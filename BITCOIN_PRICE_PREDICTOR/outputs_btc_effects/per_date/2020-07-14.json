Macro factors like inflation expectations continue to support Bitcoin as a hedge. Short-term, Bitcoin is trading sideways with low volume, showing some technical support but lacking strong conviction. Developments in regulatory compliance (FATF Travel Rule) and stablecoin growth are positive indicators for liquidity and adoption.",
