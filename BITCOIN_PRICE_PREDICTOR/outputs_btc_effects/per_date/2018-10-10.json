    "summary": "The market is showing mixed signals today. On the long-term front, the SEC's upcoming deadline for Bitcoin ETF reviews (positive) is countered by recent ETF rejections (negative). Goldman Sachs slowing its crypto plans is a bearish signal for institutional adoption, while Morgan Stanley exploring Bitcoin swaps is a bullish indicator. On the short-term horizon, the launch of regulated Bitcoin swaps by TrueEx is a positive development for institutional access. However, a significant increase in crypto theft reported by CipherTrace poses a bearish risk to sentiment and liquidity. Macroeconomic factors like easing U.S. Treasury yields and the USMCA agreement introduce minor uncertainty.",
