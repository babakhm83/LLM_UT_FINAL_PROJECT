      "summary": "The U.S. dollar has fallen to its lowest level since May 2018, dropping to 93.04 on the dollar index. This decline is attributed to the Federal Reserve's commitment to keeping interest rates near zero and the continued strength of inflation hedges like gold and silver. Bitcoin has also benefited from this trend, continuing to shine alongside precious metals.
