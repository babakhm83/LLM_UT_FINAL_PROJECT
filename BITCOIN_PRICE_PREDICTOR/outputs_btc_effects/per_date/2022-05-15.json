    "summary": "The crypto market is dominated by the catastrophic collapse of TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA, which has wiped out billions and triggered widespread fear and regulatory calls. This event is the primary driver of bearish sentiment, overshadowing any potential positive news like institutional investments. While there are tentative signs of a bounce above $30,000 for Bitcoin, these are widely considered fragile and temporary, with the risk of further downside remaining high. Increased regulatory scrutiny in key hubs like Singapore adds to the cautious outlook.",
