    "summary": "Today's market sentiment is mixed, influenced by a hawkish CPI report and Fed minutes that have dampened expectations for near-term rate cuts, leading to a bearish sentiment in traditional markets. However, Bitcoin shows resilience, trading above $70K, partly due to slowing outflows from GBTC, suggesting reduced selling pressure. Regulatory news from Hong Kong regarding potential ETF approvals offers a mild bullish outlook for Asian markets, while the SEC's delay on Bitcoin ETF options trading introduces short-term uncertainty. The upcoming BTC halving remains a key event to watch, with potential for 'sell-the-news' or continued alt-rotation dynamics.",
