      "summary": "Bitcoin experienced its worst week since the FTX collapse, falling 20% and briefly dipping below $50,000. This sharp decline was part of a broader market correction. However, the price has shown some recovery, indicating potential support at lower levels. The severity of the drop, while concerning, could also set the stage for a rebound if market sentiment shifts positively.",
