However, the market showed some resilience, with Bitcoin largely shrugging off the tweets, and some analysts suggesting this increased attention could be a net positive long-term. A significant hack on the Japanese exchange Bitpoint added to bearish sentiment, while the IRS's focus on crypto tax enforcement signaled a tightening regulatory environment. Despite the short-term bearish news, underlying market resilience and counter-narratives from financial professionals suggest potential for recovery.",
