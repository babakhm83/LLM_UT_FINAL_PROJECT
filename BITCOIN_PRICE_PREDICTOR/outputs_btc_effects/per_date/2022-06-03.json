Bitcoin has returned to the $30,000 level, supported by a rally in the NASDAQ, despite ongoing concerns about inflation and Fed policy. However, significant layoffs and hiring freezes at major exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini indicate a deepening 'crypto winter,' suggesting a contraction in the industry. Regulatory news from New York, imposing a moratorium on carbon-based crypto mining, adds to the cautious sentiment. Stronger-than-expected US jobs data is also fueling fears of continued aggressive Fed rate hikes, which typically pressures risk assets.",
