      "summary": "This article suggests that May could be a good time to buy energy stocks, contrary to the 'sell in May' adage. It highlights specific companies like Royal Dutch Shell and U.S. Silica Holdings. While focused on traditional energy, a generally positive outlook on a major sector can sometimes correlate with broader market sentiment, potentially benefiting risk assets.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn today, falling to a 3.5-week low and risking a break below $8,000, driven by the failure of the Consensus conference to provide positive catalysts and the continuation of negative sentiment from regulatory news. Further pressure came from Microsoft joining Google and Facebook in banning crypto ads, restricting marketing channels. Geopolitical tensions from the cancellation of North-South Korea talks also contributed to a risk-off environment. On the infrastructure front, the launch of 'Quickbooks for Crypto' by Blox.io offers a positive development for business adoption, but it was overshadowed by broader market pressures.",
