      "summary": "Bitcoin has experienced a pullback of up to 13% from its record high, trading around $68,000. While this sell-off is attributed to profit-taking, crypto experts remain optimistic about the upcoming halving event driving Bitcoin to new highs. This suggests that the current dip is viewed as a temporary correction within a broader bullish trend.",
