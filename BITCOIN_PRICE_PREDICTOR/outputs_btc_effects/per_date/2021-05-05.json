Long-term, institutional adoption continues to be a strong bullish driver, with hedge funds increasing exposure and major financial institutions like JPMorgan and CME Group making positive outlooks or launching new products. However, technical indicators like the Pi Cycle suggest potential overheating. Short-term, Ethereum's price surge and associated liquidations, along with the integration of Bitcoin into banking infrastructure via FIS and NYDIG, point to bullish momentum. The inclusion of crypto in S&P indices also adds legitimacy. However, the broader market sentiment remains sensitive to macro factors and regulatory discussions.",
