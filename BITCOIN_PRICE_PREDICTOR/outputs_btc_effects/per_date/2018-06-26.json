On the long-term front, institutional interest is growing with Polychain Capital reaching a $1 billion fund and Robinhood planning a crypto wallet, indicating positive adoption trends. However, cautionary notes from figures like Bill Gates and economist Robert Shiller, alongside restrictive regulations in Zimbabwe, highlight ongoing skepticism and regulatory hurdles. Short-term, a general 'risk-off' sentiment in broader markets due to trade war fears could pressure crypto prices. Positive developments include the launch of a Bitcoin ATM in South Africa and potential tax policy changes in Japan, suggesting increased accessibility and a more favorable environment.
