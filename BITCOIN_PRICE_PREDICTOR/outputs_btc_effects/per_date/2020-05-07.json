This disconnect suggests a potential for market corrections if economic realities catch up. While the article focuses on traditional markets, the sentiment analysis is relevant. If the optimism is misplaced, it could lead to a broader risk-off sentiment, potentially impacting Bitcoin, though its decoupling narrative might offer some protection.",
