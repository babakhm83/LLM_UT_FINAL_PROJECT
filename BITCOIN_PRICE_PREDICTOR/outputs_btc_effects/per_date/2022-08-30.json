He emphasized the use of 'forceful' tools, implying continued aggressive interest rate hikes. This hawkish stance is expected to negatively impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as higher rates increase borrowing costs and reduce liquidity.",

This rise is attributed to North American miners ramping up operations ahead of cooler weather.
