    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a mixed Saturday, failing to break through the $9,700 resistance level, indicating short-term consolidation. Long-term sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, driven by institutional adoption news like the TSX listing of a Bitcoin fund and the launch of a Bitcoin 401(k) plan. The upcoming halving's impact is still a key bullish driver, while broader socio-political narratives around financial sovereignty could also support adoption.",
