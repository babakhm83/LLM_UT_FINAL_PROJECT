    "summary": "The crypto market shows signs of a positive start to 2023, with Bitcoin and Ethereum posting modest weekly gains, and Solana experiencing a significant rally. However, this optimism is tempered by the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes, which suggest interest rates may remain higher for longer, creating a bearish macro backdrop. Additionally, a focus on blue-chip and value stocks indicates a market leaning towards stability and risk aversion, potentially drawing capital away from speculative assets. Increased OTC selling activity in Dubai adds to the mixed signals.",
