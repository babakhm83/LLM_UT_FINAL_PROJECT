    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a notable sell-off today, dropping 3% amidst concerns about sticky inflation indicated by higher-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data. This macro data point suggests the Federal Reserve might delay interest rate cuts, creating a risk-off sentiment. However, positive developments continue in the ETF space, with predictions that Ether ETFs could outperform Bitcoin ETFs, and ongoing strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are still providing underlying support. The definitive ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto also removed a layer of legal uncertainty, which is a net positive for market sentiment.",
