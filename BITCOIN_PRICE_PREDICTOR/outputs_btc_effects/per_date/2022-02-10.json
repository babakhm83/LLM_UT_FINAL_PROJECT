    "summary": "Bitcoin showed resilience today, defying the broader market sell-off driven by high inflation data (7.5% CPI). It rallied above $45,000, potentially acting as an inflation hedge, while other cryptocurrencies dipped. However, the hot inflation data also increased expectations for aggressive Fed rate hikes, creating market uncertainty. Institutional sentiment remains mixed, with UBS suggesting caution on direct crypto investments, while legendary investor Bill Miller maintains a strong conviction in Bitcoin as 'insurance.' Regulatory developments are also in focus, with El Salvador rejecting IMF calls to drop Bitcoin, but facing a Fitch downgrade ahead of its Bitcoin bond issuance. The recovery in Bitcoin's price, despite macroeconomic headwinds, suggests a complex market dynamic.",
