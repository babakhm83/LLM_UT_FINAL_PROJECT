Long-term, institutional adoption and regulatory clarity remain key drivers, with significant Bitcoin purchases by the Luna Foundation Guard and the U.S. government exploring crypto oversight providing bullish undertones. However, analyst views on corporate crypto holdings remain divided. Short-term, crypto funds are seeing inflows for the second week, and new real-world use cases for Bitcoin are emerging, such as fuel purchases. Miners are also reporting strong production, and tech giants are launching more efficient mining hardware, all contributing to a cautiously optimistic short-term outlook.",
