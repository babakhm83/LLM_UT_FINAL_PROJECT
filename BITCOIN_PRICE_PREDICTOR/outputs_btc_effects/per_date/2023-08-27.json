      "summary": "The new social-media crypto project Friend.tech is reportedly being overrun by bots and 'speculative games,' leading to its rapid fizzle after a peak. This indicates potential issues with user experience, platform integrity, and sustainability. Such fads can draw attention and liquidity away from established assets like Bitcoin in the short term, but their quick decline often leads to a reallocation of capital back to more stable assets.",
