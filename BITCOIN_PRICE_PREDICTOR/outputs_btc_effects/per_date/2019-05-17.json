    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a severe flash crash today, plummeting by over 20% from recent highs due to a large sell order on Bitstamp, leading to significant liquidations on derivatives exchanges like BitMEX. While some analysts see this as a potential catalyst for a future rally, the immediate impact is a sharp increase in volatility and a bearish sentiment across the market. Macroeconomic data remains mixed, with US retail sales disappointing, which could weaken the dollar and indirectly support crypto, but the dominant short-term signal is the sharp price decline and its implications for market stability.",
