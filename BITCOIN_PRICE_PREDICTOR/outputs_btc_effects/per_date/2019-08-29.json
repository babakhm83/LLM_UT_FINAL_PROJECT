Geopolitical news, such as China denying reports of a state-backed cryptocurrency, also contributed to a broader market downturn. Regulatory actions, like the US government blacklisting Bitcoin addresses, signal increasing enforcement, adding to short-term uncertainty. However, some positive developments include the integration of BitPay with Blockchain Wallet, enhancing Bitcoin's payment utility, and Ethereum showing a slight weekly recovery, though still underperforming Bitcoin.",
