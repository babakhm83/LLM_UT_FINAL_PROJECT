      "summary": "Bitcoin's price has broken above $12,000, reaching a one-month high, supported by increased trading volumes and bullish daily chart indicators. The price is expected to extend gains towards $13,200. However, the 4-hour chart indicates overbought conditions and bearish divergence, suggesting a potential pullback to $11,800-$11,600. A close above $12,000 confirms a falling channel breakout, but a drop below $10,545 would weaken the bullish case.",
