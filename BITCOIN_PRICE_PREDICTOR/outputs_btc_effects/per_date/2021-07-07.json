Long-term, institutional adoption continues to be a strong theme with Ark Invest and Morgan Stanley's involvement, alongside potential adoption in Mexico. However, short-term, Bitcoin dominance is declining, suggesting altcoins may be gaining ground. Goldman Sachs' bullish view on Ether is also a notable short-term catalyst. Regulatory sentiment from central bankers remains cautious, while new stablecoin launches and mining expansions indicate ongoing infrastructure development.",
