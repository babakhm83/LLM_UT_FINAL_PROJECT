    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a mixed day with a notable dip followed by a partial recovery, ending Sunday with a 5.2% gain. The market remains sensitive to regulatory news and environmental concerns, as highlighted by the ongoing debate around Bitcoin's energy consumption and UK banks restricting crypto transfers. However, positive developments like institutional interest from figures like Ray Dalio and strategic hires by Coinbase, alongside strong altcoin performance driven by smart contract updates (e.g., Cardano), suggest underlying bullish sentiment for certain segments of the crypto market. Whale buying during the dip also indicates resilience.",
