    "summary": "Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop below $60,000 following the Federal Reserve's announcement of a 50 basis point interest rate cut, a move that was largely anticipated but led to a 'sell the news' reaction. Arthur Hayes warned of a 'nuclear catastrophe' for markets if the Fed cut by 50bps, adding to bearish sentiment. However, positive signals include MicroStrategy's continued Bitcoin accumulation and Donald Trump's public use of Bitcoin, which provide some bullish counter-narrative. The market is reacting to the Fed's dovish policy shift, creating immediate volatility.",
