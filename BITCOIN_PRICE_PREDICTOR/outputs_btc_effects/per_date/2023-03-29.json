    "summary": "Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, trading above $28,000 and heading for its best quarter in two years, outperforming traditional assets. This strength persists despite the CFTC's lawsuit against Binance, which has led to significant outflows from the exchange. Positive sentiment is further bolstered by easing banking sector fears and anticipation of a less aggressive Fed policy. XRP is also seeing a surge in open interest and price, driven by hopes for a favorable legal outcome. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on macro factors and regulatory developments.",
