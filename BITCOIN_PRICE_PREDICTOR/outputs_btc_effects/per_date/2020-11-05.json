While some on-chain metrics like high Ethereum gas fees highlight scaling challenges, the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with strong investor accumulation and mainstream media attention fueling FOMO. The Federal Reserve's continued accommodative stance further supports risk assets. However, a large Bitcoin seizure by the US DOJ introduces a note of regulatory caution.",
