    "summary": "Bitcoin remains range-bound, indicating market indecision, with technicals suggesting a potential short-term downside. However, positive developments in institutional infrastructure, such as Nasdaq's Quandl adding crypto data and Metaco securing custody insurance via Aon, provide long-term bullish signals. The addition of a new Bitcoin Core maintainer is a positive for protocol development. Meanwhile, regulatory monitoring in the Philippines and potential cost increases for miners in Iran and Russia introduce minor uncertainties.",
