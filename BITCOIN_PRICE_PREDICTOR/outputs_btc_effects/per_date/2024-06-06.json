In the mining sector, significant takeover activity is driving mining stock performance, with Riot Platforms acquiring a stake in Bitfarms, and Core Scientific rejecting a buyout offer. Robinhood's acquisition of Bitstamp signals further mainstream integration, while institutional interest is broadening with Franklin Templeton considering a new crypto fund.",
