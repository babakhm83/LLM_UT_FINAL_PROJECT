    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike was largely priced in, with market focus shifting to forward guidance. Bitcoin remained relatively stable around $28,600. Positive developments include increased Bitcoin transaction volume driven by Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, signaling growing network utility. However, a proposed 30% tax on crypto mining electricity could increase operational costs for miners, potentially impacting hash rates. Concerns about the banking sector, highlighted by PacWest's struggles, continue to drive safe-haven flows into Bitcoin, while a depegging event for TrueUSD introduces stablecoin-related risks.",
