      "summary": "Blockchain forensics startup Elliptic, in collaboration with MIT and IBM, has released the largest-ever labeled dataset of Bitcoin transactions, comprising 200,000 transactions valued at $6 billion. This dataset will help train machine learning algorithms to identify illicit activities. While this is a positive development for network security and regulatory compliance, its immediate impact on price is likely neutral.",

This positive price action is lifting the broader crypto market. However, some altcoins like Bitcoin Cash ABC are experiencing sharp declines, indicating sector-specific weakness. Macroeconomic factors like oil prices and the NZD's weakness due to rate cuts are providing mixed signals for broader risk sentiment, but the dominant narrative for Bitcoin is bullish.",
