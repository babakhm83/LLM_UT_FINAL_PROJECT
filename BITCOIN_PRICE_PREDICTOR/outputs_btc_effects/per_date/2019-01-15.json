    "summary": "The crypto market shows mixed signals today. Long-term, institutional skepticism from UBS (Donovan) continues to weigh on sentiment, while adoption drivers like Revolut's banking license and the potential for Bitcoin in authoritarian countries offer a more optimistic outlook. Short-term, Bitcoin futures trading at a discount and continued market slumps suggest bearish pressure, though a slight price recovery towards $3,700 and exchange support for Ethereum's hard fork provide minor bullish counterpoints. The key resistance level at the 10-week SMA remains a critical technical indicator.",
