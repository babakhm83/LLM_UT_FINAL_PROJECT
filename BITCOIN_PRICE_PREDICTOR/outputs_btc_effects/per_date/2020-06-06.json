      "summary": "Since the start of 2020, Bitcoin's price movements have closely mirrored those of the US stock market, particularly the S&P 500. This correlation intensified following the COVID-19 pandemic, with Bitcoin experiencing a sell-off in late February that mirrored the broader market's decline. The subsequent Federal Reserve stimulus measures in March also saw Bitcoin prices begin to bottom and rally in anticipation. This suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being influenced by macroeconomic factors and traditional market sentiment, rather than solely its own internal dynamics.",
