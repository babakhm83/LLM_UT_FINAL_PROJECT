However, significant headwinds remain, including a major $100 million hack on Harmony's Horizon bridge, which could dampen sentiment. Meanwhile, exchanges like Binance are initiating fee wars, and Coinbase is expanding into derivatives, indicating continued industry development despite the 'crypto winter'.
