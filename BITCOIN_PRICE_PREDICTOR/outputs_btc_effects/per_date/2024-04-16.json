      "summary": "Several top altcoins experienced price declines on Tuesday, with sentiment dampened by a Federal Reserve pronouncement and following a recent crypto rally. While losses were not massive, the downward trend in altcoins, which often follow Bitcoin's lead, suggests a broader market sentiment shift or profit-taking. This indicates potential weakness in the altcoin market in the immediate short term.",
