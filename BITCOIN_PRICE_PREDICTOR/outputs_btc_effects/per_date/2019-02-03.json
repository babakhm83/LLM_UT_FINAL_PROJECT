The author suggests that as institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin, it could lead to a split in its future development and market perception. This bifurcation could impact how Bitcoin is used and valued, potentially creating different market segments or even distinct versions of the asset. The long-term implications hinge on how these competing forces of institutional demand and the core principles of decentralization play out.",
