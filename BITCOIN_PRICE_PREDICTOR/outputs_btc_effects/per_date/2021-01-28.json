      "summary": "Scott Minerd, CIO of Guggenheim Partners, expressed doubt in late January 2021 about whether institutional demand was sufficient to sustain Bitcoin's price above $30,000. He suggested that the institutional investor base was not yet deep enough to justify the current valuation. These comments, coming from a firm that had previously shown interest in Bitcoin, could dampen institutional enthusiasm and lead to short-term price pressure if other institutions echo similar sentiments.",

Institutional interest, as indicated by Ray Dalio's cautious remarks and Guggenheim's CIO's doubts about sustained institutional demand above $30K, suggests a cautious approach from major players. However, continued corporate conviction from companies like MicroStrategy and positive developments in core protocol funding provide underlying support.",
