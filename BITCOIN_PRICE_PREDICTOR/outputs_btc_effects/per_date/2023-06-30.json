      "summary": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged past $300, reaching a 14-month high, driven by its listing on EDX Markets and a significant increase in trading volume on South Korea's Upbit exchange. This surge, coupled with strong performance from Litecoin, suggests a rotation into certain altcoins that have been overlooked. The increased trading activity and price appreciation in BCH indicate renewed investor interest and potential for short-term momentum.",
