3) For each pick, provide direction (bullish/bearish/uncertain), magnitude (low/medium/high), confidence (0–1), and short rationale.
4) Engineer **features_for_model**: short tokens/phrases/entities that a forecasting model can ingest (e.g., 'ETF_flow', 'SEC_approval', 'Lightning_capacity', 'exchange_outage', 'CPI_surprise').
5) Produce a **daily_view** with scenario probabilities and explicit BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations for short-term and long-term, plus key risks and watch items.
