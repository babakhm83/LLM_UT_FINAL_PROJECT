The U.S. Dollar Index managed to settle above the 96 level and is testing the next resistance level which is located at 96.25. A move above this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at 96.50 which may be bearish for silver and gold price today, although it should be noted that precious metals have ignored stronger dollar during the current trading session.
