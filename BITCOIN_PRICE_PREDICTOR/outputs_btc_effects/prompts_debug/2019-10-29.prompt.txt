This means Galaxy owners will be able to store the coin on the phone itself, and use it within apps. As a result, Tron becomes the fourth coin available on the Blockchain Keystore, following Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) and Klaytn (KLAY) . It also confirms speculation that the “hundred billion USD megacorporation” that Tron CEO Justin Sun teased on October 25, was Samsung after all. “This is a remarkable milestone for TRON, and I’m thrilled to h"}

Since the new amount of Litecoin being mined was cut in half on August 5, the network’s hash rate —computing power that protects the network from attack—has similarly fallen. Every four years, Litecoin undergoes a halving, where the mining rewards that cryptocurrency miners receive for mining new blocks get cut in half—it’s the same with Bitcoin . However, when this happens, it means that miners receive less money when mining new blocks—making it uneconomical to continue spending computational resources earning new coins. While Litecoin fou"}

In Friday’s filing, the SEC ridiculed Kik’s defense that vagueness shields them from legal woes: Related: Paxos Wins SEC ‘No-Action’"}
