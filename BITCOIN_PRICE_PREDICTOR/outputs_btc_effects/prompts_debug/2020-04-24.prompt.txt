Markets were shocked when the May futures contract on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the main oil benchmark for the U.S., crashed Monday on fears arising from massive oversupply due to the effects of the coronavirus measures. A day later, the June contract tumbled more than 43 percent to a 21-year low of $11.57 a barrel. Bitcoin , though, barely flinched and held within its rece"}

The statement implies a depressing trade-off of deaths for privacy. Although it recorded its first COVID-19 case on the same date, the U.S. currently has, per capita, 13 times South Korea’s caseload and a shocking 33 times its deaths. It’s also a depressingly defeatist notion. The trade-off need not exist. The U.S. could and"}

But with concerns about privacy running high, getting a contact tracing app voluntarily adopted at scale is a big ask. Governments around the world are weighing different privacy-enhancing designs, with some saying an app would be voluntary to begin with, but not ruling out making it compulsory. A now oft-cited statistic, Singapore’s TraceTogether app was adopted by only 10-20 percent of the population, with the country’s government now calling on everyone to download it. In the U.K., for example, experts believe some 60 percent of the po"}

The top cryptocurrency by market value is widely considered to be a hedge against inflation because its supply is capped at 21 million and its monetary policy is pre-programmed to cut the pace of supply expansion by 50 percent every four years. As such, one may consider any deflationary collapse as a price-bearish development for bitcoin . Talk of deflation began earlier this m"}
