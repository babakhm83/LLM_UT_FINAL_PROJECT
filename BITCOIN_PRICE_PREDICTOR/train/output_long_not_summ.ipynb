This is the panel at the U.S. central bank that sets monetary policy, and the interest-rate decisions announced after its monthly meetings are the subject of much soothsaying and Kremlinology ( in the figurative sense) . While officials from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and regional Fed banks have expressed a range of views about crypto in recent months, from welcoming to wary , this appears to be the first time the topic has come up in the FOMC.

Released Wednesday, the minutes did not say which members of the 11-seat committee voiced these concerns. A few officials also highlighted the need to regulate stablecoins, according to the minutes. The officials noted the “fragility and lack of transparency associated with stablecoins, the importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products,” according to the minutes. Related: Facebook: Novi Digital Wallet Is ‘Ready to Come to Market’ While the document does not elaborate, one reason FOMC members may be concerned is the investments made by issuers of stablecoins, which are supposed to be redeemable 1-for-1 with dollars, and the potential for a sell-off in the underlying assets should these outfits be hit with a high number of redemption requests simultaneously. Story continues “There’s increasing evidence that [stablecoins] are material players in the commercial paper market and operating like unregulated money market funds—which aren’t even stable themselves ,” Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises, told CoinDesk.

By reaching that area, we got a little bit overextended, and then pulled back quite significantly to reach down towards the $5.50 level towards the end of the Friday session. All things been equal, this is a bit of a shooting star, but at this point I still think we are a long way away from forming a new downtrend. Quite frankly, it is very likely that we would see buyers on dips, and that is exactly how I plan on playing this market.\n",
      "I believe that the $5.00 level should continue to offer a significant amount of support, at least from a psychological standpoint, if not a structural one. There is still a significant amount of demand for natural gas in the European Union, and as long as that is going to be the case, I think it is difficult to short this market. The market is significantly bullish, and therefore it is going to take a significant amount of a fundamental shift in order to make this market fall apart.\n",
      "That being the case, I would be short and probably aggressively so, but until demand suddenly falls apart, there is no way to do that. As to where we end up to the upside, it is almost impossible to tell, but it should be noted that the momentum is still there, so I think that we will continue to see plenty of value hunters looking to pick up natural gas.\n",

Meanwhile, Bitcoin received strong support near the $46,000 level and is testing the resistance level which has recently emerged at $48,000. In case Bitcoin manages to settle above the resistance at $48,000, it will gain additional upside momentum and head towards the psychologically important resistance level at $50,000 which will be bullish for the whole crypto market. It should be noted that Bitcoin Dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of total crypto market capitalization, has recently managed to settle below the 45% level and continues to move lower. The recent developments indicate that traders remain interested in altcoins which is bullish for Dogecoin. Technical Analysis Dogecoin gained strong upside momentum after it managed to get above $0.30 but faced resistance near $0.35. Currently, Dogecoin is trying to stabilize between the nearest support level, which has emerged at $0.33, and the resistance at $0.35. RSI has reached multi-month highs which means that the risks of a pullback are significant. In case Dogecoin manages to settle below the support level at $0.33, it will move towards the next support at $0.3150. A successful test of the support at $0.3150 will push Dogecoin towards the next support level at $0.2950. No material levels were formed between $0.2950 and $0.3150 so this move may be fast. On the upside, Dogecoin needs to settle above the resistance at $0.35 to continue its upside move. The next resistance level for Dogecoin is located at $0.36. In case Dogecoin manages to settle above this level, it will head towards the next resistance level which is located at $0.38. A move above $0.38 will open the way to the test of the resistance at $0.3950. It should be noted that cryptocurrencies are very dependent on momentum so Dogecoin has decent chances to continue its upside move despite high RSI.

Avoiding sub-$46,500 will be Key || UPDATE 2-Bitcoin price rises past $50,000 then retreats: (Updates prices, adds analyst comment) LONDON/CHICAGO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Bitcoin's price surged past $50,000 on Monday for the first time since May, but the rebound from a months-long slump later ran out of steam. The world's largest cryptocurrency was last down 0.2% at $49,201. It had risen as high as $50,562 as investors bet that the prospect of more U.S. stimulus spending would lead to further gains, and more mainstream financial services firms made moves in the nascent asset class. Bitcoin has climbed 82% since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in January. The price retreat was predominately driven by profit taking, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, who also pointed to a report that some bitcoin mining from China might abruptly go offline on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the price of rival cryptocurrency ether was last up 1.97% at $3,305. The virtual coin has risen 91% since slumping to below $1,740 last month. The cryptocurrency recovery comes as some more established financial services companies offer their customers access to virtual coins. PayPal Holdings Inc said on Monday it would allow customers in Britain to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. Moya said that fears of capital gains taxation has led some traders to hold cryptocurrency as a long-term investment, removing some volatility from the market. \"New investors are the key to this latest bitcoin rally and all signs show they are comfortable with high risk,\" he said in an email, adding that bitcoin \"could see a fast appreciation here and might not hesitate making a run for $60,000 if appetite for risky assets remain intact.\" Others also believe the upswing could have further to go if more retail investors return to the market. \"The last time bitcoin was at $50,000, the Google trends (tracking website showing bitcoin searches) was much higher than what it is now,\" Marcus Sotiriou, a sales trader at the UK based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in a note. \"This suggests that retail euphoria hasn't entered the market yet and bitcoin has a long way to go in this market cycle.\" (Reporting by Anna Irrera in London and Karen Pierog in Chicago; Editing by David Holmes, Alison Williams and Jonathan Oatis) View comments || Bitcoin, ether slump as market selloff widens: By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Saikat Chatterjee NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Cryptocurrency prices sank on Monday as concerns over the spillover risk to the global economy from Chinese property group Evergrande's troubles spread across financial markets. Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, tumbled to $42,453.97, its lowest level since Aug. 7 before trimming some losses to trade down 7.4% at $43,745. It hit a near four-month high above $52,000 on Sept. 6. Smaller rival ether, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, fell more than 10% below $3,000 for the first time since early August. It was last down 7.6% at $3,071. Market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market dropped 10% on Monday to under $1.94 trillion, from last Saturday's $2.17 trillion. The loss in the value of cryptocurrencies comes at a time when institutional interest in the space has surged and some investment banks have ramped up their forecasts for cryptocurrencies in the coming months. \"It's red, red, red across the board today as the cryptocurrency markets follow the downturn being seen in traditional markets as China battles a highly-contagious property market crisis,\" said Tim Frost, chief executive officer at Yield App, a financial technology company that enables users to invest in decentralized finance. \"Bitcoin has lost support at the $44,000 mark and looks set to test its $39,000 floor. If it falls through here we can expect a significant correction to come,\" he added. Bitcoin shorts in the futures markets have increased to 1,187 contracts, the largest since early August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday.

Now he is hooked even though the financial authorities disapprove. \"Crypto just allows me to transact freely and within minutes we are done with our transactions,\" the 28-year-old told Reuters from a friend's studio in Lagos where he displays his works. Nigeria's Central Bank barred local banks from working with cryptocurrencies in February, warning of \"severe regulatory sanctions\" and freezing accounts of firms it says are using them. But Joseph's appetite for crypto, like many in Nigeria, has only increased. For people like him, the clampdown has highlighted the benefits of using currencies outside the central bank's control, and Nigeria remains the largest market for cryptocurrency trading platforms like Paxful. Nigerians are turning to crypto for business, to protect their savings as the naira loses value, and to send payments abroad because it is often hard to obtain U.S. dollars, experts and users told Reuters. In March, just after the central bank ban, the dollar volume of cryptocurrencies sent from Nigeria rose to $132 million, up 17% from the previous month, research firm Chainalysis said. Transactions in June were 25% above the same month last year. Sly Megida, another artist using crypto to sell his works, said his buyers worldwide readily accept the use of digital currencies and they have also protected his finances. \"The naira is digressing and we are trying to keep the value of the art,\" he said, calling crypto \"the currency where people don't think that I am paying too much or too less\". DANGERS REMAIN The Paxful peer-to-peer platform that Joseph uses experienced a 57% rise in trading volume in Nigeria in the year to June, while user numbers surged 83%. Exchange Yellowcard, which has adopted the peer-to-peer model in Nigeria since February, told Reuters that use \"has continued to absolutely skyrocket\". Story continues Both Paxful, which has opened an office in Abuja to lobby the government to change its attitude to crypto, and Yellowcard said Nigerians generally turn to crypto for business rather than speculation. Chainalysis, in a report last month on African crypto, said the central bank ban locked most Nigerians out of traditional crypto exchanges, so many shifted to a peer-to-peer system. This goes via platforms such as Paxful or Local Bitcoins, which vet both parties. But other users just exchange crypto for Nigerian naira or other currencies with people they find on WhatsApp or Telegram. As a result, Chainalysis said Nigeria's crypto use is likely even higher than its figures suggest. Risks remain, however. In August, the central bank froze the accounts of some crypto users for allegedly sourcing funds from illegal foreign exchange dealers, leaving many companies that use cryptocurrencies reluctant to talk about it. Joseph, though, is undeterred. \"You can sell to people outside the country, and they can actually pay in different currencies, which you can always convert,\" Joseph said.

Bitcoin, the biggest and the best known cryptocurrency, traded around $43,000, recovering from a fall to $40,192 earlier in the session. It hit a four-month high of $52,000 on Sept 6. Smaller rival ether, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain, rose 1% to $3,012 after falling below $3,000 for the first time since early August. Global markets started the week on a turbulent note after fears that Evergrande's troubles could lead to a fallout for the Chinese and global economies prompted a selloff in riskier assets. \"We can't take a very positive view just as yet until we get through the next few days,\" said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer at crypto index fund provider Singapore-based Stack Funds. \"This is purely sentiment driven right now, and it's actually been off very low liquidity,\" he said, adding that it would be better to wait on the sidelines as crypto markets will continue to be affected by the contagion. The drop in cryptocurrencies comes at a time when institutional interest in the space has risen and made it more mainstream, with many investment banks taking a more bullish stance. (Reporting by Anushka Trivedi in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin) || Comparing Dogecoin, Baby Doge and Shiba Inu: Is There One To Watch?: RoamingPanda / Getty Images Bitcoin has been the most popular and well-known cryptocurrency since it literally began the asset class in 2009. However, as speculative fervor has broken out among many markets over the past few years, literally hundreds of new cryptocurrencies have been created, with many skyrocketing in price. Some of these newer cryptos don’t, as of yet, have any discernible value in the blockchain world, and many have whimsical names, such as Dogecoin, Baby Doge and Shiba Inu. Here’s a look at the story behind these three particular cryptos and whether or not they are worth keeping tabs on as an investor. Find Out More: Is the Shiba Inu Coin the Cryptocurrency You Should Be Watching? See: Where Does Cryptocurrency Come From? Dogecoin Dogecoin was initially created as a joke by two software engineers in December 2013, with a Shiba Inu — a breed of hunting dog in Japan — as its mascot. What began as a joke is now a full-fledged, functioning cryptocurrency. In fact, as of Aug. 9, Dogecoin has the fifth-largest market cap of any cryptocurrency at $31 billion. Consider: Dogecoin’s Highs and Lows: Is It Still Worth an Investment? Part of the reason that Dogecoin is so well-known is thanks to the tweets of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Some market participants have even dubbed Musk the “Dogefather” for his support of the crypto. Yet, Musk is not alone in his support for Dogecoin. Billionaire entrepreneur and “Shark Tank” investor Mark Cuban told CNBC’s “Make It” that Dogecoin is the “strongest” cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, to which Elon Musk immediately agreed, tweeting, “I’ve been saying this for a while.” All of this combined to spike Dogecoin’s price yet again, rising about 10% in 24 hours. Although investing in any cryptocurrency is a speculation, the former “joke” crypto seems to have staying power. The coin actually exists as a medium of exchange, and it’s got backing from at least two prominent and popular billionaires. More Economy Explained: Ethereum (ETH): What It Is, What It’s Worth and Should You Be Investing? Story continues Baby Doge Baby Doge is another crypto with a fanciful side, as it was designed by the Dogecoin community as the offspring of its “father,” Doge. The crypto’s own website emphasizes its playfulness, as it states that “Baby Doge seeks to impress his father by showing his new improved transaction speeds & adorableness.” Unlike other cryptos, however, Baby Doge isn’t meant to be used as a currency. Rather, owners are incentivized to simply hold on to the coin and hope that it increases in value. While Dogecoin, along with many other cryptos, has no cap on the amount that can be mined, Baby Doge is pre-mined, meaning no more can be created. According to the Baby Doge website, this makes the coin hyper-deflationary and designed to become more scarce over time. Baby Doge holders are rewarded with a 5% fee from every transaction on the Baby Doge network, paid in Baby Doge. An additional 5% of each transaction is retained by the network for liquidity. Read: How To Invest In Cryptocurrency: What You Should Know Before Investing Although Baby Doge references its transaction speeds as a draw for investors, it’s really focused on increasing its price via a six-pronged roadmap. While the supply of Baby Doge is “limited,” that cap sits at a massive 420 quadrillion tokens, part of the reason its current share price is at an unbelievably low $0.000000001464, as of Aug. 23. The idea is that with a share price so low, early adopters will want to hoard massive numbers of tokens in the hopes of an eventual payoff. Take a Look: What Is the Next Big Cryptocurrency To Explode in 2021? Shiba Inu Shiba Inu was originally created as the mascot for Dogecoin, but now it operates as its own token on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike some cryptos which limit their supply, Shiba Inu acts more like Baby Doge, with a nearly unfathomable circulation of 1 quadrillion coins. Shiba Inu has a similarly low price, at just $0.0000082 as of Aug. 23. One major difference between Baby Doge and Shiba Inu, however, is that Shiba Inu strives to be an Ethereum-based alternative to Dogecoin by supporting an NFT art incubator and other projects on its decentralized exchange known as Shibaswap. Find Out: Why Some Money Experts Believe In Bitcoin and Others Don’t As Shiba Inu serves a workable function and is based on popular and well-known Ethereum, some investors believe that it might have more legs than Baby Doge. However, Shiba Inu is still extremely speculative, and like many altcoins trying to find their place in the crypto universe, a single tweet can create massive price movements up or down. Not surprisingly, Elon Musk is one of the main culprits with Shiba Inu as well; a single tweet from Musk stating, “My Shiba Inu will be named Floki,” was enough to push the Shiba Inu price up 25%. Investors would be wise to tread with caution on this one.

The rebound from 24-hour lows of $44,248 follows a period of profit-taking on Tuesday on the back of short-term fatigue, as CoinDesk reported . Bitcoin is currently changing hands at around $45,000 and is down 2.9% from a 24-hour high of $47,157, CoinDesk data show. Bitcoin continues to cool upon multiple attempts at $50,000, evoking moments of price action gone by, though that may be less of a concern now given demand from bigger players, according to some market participants. Related: Bitcoin Lightning Network Growth Passes New Milestones In comparison to the bull runs in 2017 and 2018, the current movement takes a more mature trend, said Cynthia Wu, head of sales at Singapore-based digital asset services firm Matrixport. The market landscape has become much more institutionalized  where now you have proprietary traders in crypto hedge funds, crypto-offerings from foreign exchange brokers and institutions ",
      " that are transacting on an institutional scale. The price trend for bitcoin and the fusion of retail and institutional interest are signs that the search for yield by investors, big or small, has extended into crypto and will be around for good, Wu added. Bitcoins daily price action remains relatively flat with the weight of the previously discussed 200-day moving average bearing down on prices near $45,500, a sign that further selling pressure could be lurking around the corner. Meanwhile, the altcoin market continues to hold firm with most in the top 20 coins by market cap remaining in the green over the past seven days. Related: How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Use? Overall, the markets have seen a positive trend continue this week; altcoins are up while bitcoin has coasted flat, said Byron Goldberg, Australian country manager at crypto exchange Luno. Interestingly, we are seeing ether slightly outperform bitcoin week-on-week. Story continues Over a 30-day period, ether is up 67.6%, compared with bitcoins 46.3% rise during the same period, Messari data shows. Goldberg points to Ethereums London hard fork as the likely catalyst for driving prices higher. Indeed, futures premium on ether stands at 7.36%, compared with bitcoins meagre 2.8%, meaning the crypto markets are likely anticipating ether to rise further than bitcoin over the next three months with a shift in institutional interest, Goldberg added. All major cryptos in the top 20 posted results in the red over a 24-hour period by press time. Dogecoin shed the most, while uniswap and chainlink followed close behind.

Twitter has announced new features for its platform, including more flexible controls and the ability to send cryptocurrency between users. Twitter is adding Bitcoin to its Tips feature, which allowed users to send money to others through PayPal and other third-party services, and rolling that out throughout the world. This allows users to add their bitcoin wallet to their profile and send the cryptocurrency directly within the app, starting today, through Strike, a third-party a payments application built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Breaking: Twitter is adding the ability to pay users with Bitcoin directly in the app as it rolls out its Tips feature to users globally. https://t.co/5EL7mXVeUK pic.twitter.com/mbyrP4BwHv — Adam Smith (@adamndsmith) September 23, 2021 Tips was originally only available for selected users but will now be accessible to users on iPhones with Android users coming soon. Twitter says that users in countries like Africa might not have access to traditional providers, and bitcoin represents “one of the best solutions” of “forward-looking” solutions. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey has been a long advocate of cryptocurrency, saying that it would “unite the world” and believes it will become the “ native currency of the internet ”. Tipping is entirely on third-party platforms, so does not receive a cut from donations; when users choose a service, it will open the app or a website. The bitcoin lightning wallet invoice is generated by Twitter when transferring crypto currency, and when that invoice is paid off-platform the social media site will send a notification to the receiver that can be replied with using a preset reply or emojis. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also becoming a bigger part of Twitter, with the company ‘exploring’ NFT authentication, letting users directly connect their crypto wallets and show off their NFT ownership on Twitter. Story continues In a call with reporters, Twitter’s Product Lead for Conversational Safety Christine Su also said that the company will be introducing a way to leave a conversation that they have been tagged in and is ‘exploring’ word filters to remove unwanted speech or “targeted name calling” as well as emojis and other terms. These updates follow Twitter’s other changes, such as allowing users to control who can reply and the “Safety Mode” that the company is testing to auto-block accounts , as well as allowing users to remove followers – which was previously done via ‘soft blocking’, which is when someone blocks and then unblocks a user. Twitter is adding more context to its tweets so people can “trust who they are talking to”, Su says, by adding profile labels and a new “heads up” experiment that will inform users when they are joining a “potentially heated discussion” through a label underneath a Tweet, the company showed in a concept mock-up. Twitter will be finding these ‘vibes’, which is in “early days”, using automated technology, but eventually wants to allow authors to set their own tones to the conversation – comparing its experiment to Following up with its Communities feature, Twitter is trying to let users “set their own norms”.

I've also done my best to keep most of that out of this newsletter -- it's a weird niche interest that's especially niche at the moment -- but as Bitcoin flirts with a new all-time-high and the NFT mania persists, just consider this a timely update.\n",
      "So, in the past month, investors have continued dropping billions upon billions of dollars on NFTs. OpenSeahas seen more than $3 billion in transaction volumein the past 30 days, and that number is actually way down quite a bit from August, showcasing just how much off-peak money continues to flow into NFTs.\n",
      "All of that money has gone to some colorful places. One of the bigger success stories of the past month has been the platform CrypToadz which investors dumped $100 million into. They look likethis. In the past couple weeks, a brand new project called MekaVerse saw $130 million in transaction volume. They'rea bit prettier, but would you spend more than $8,000 on one? The platformCryptoslam(where I pulled most of the data I reference here) is tracking 163 platforms which did more than $1 million in volume in the past 30 days, a number which doesn't even account for individual artists selling their work on platforms like OpenSea.\n",
      "NBA Top Shot creator on the NFT craze and why Ethereum still isn’t consumer friendly\n",
      "Now, there are two incredibly different segments of NFT communities out there, larger-scale NFT projects likeAxie Infinityand NBA Top Shot with tens and hundreds of thousands of users and smaller-scale NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Art Blocks with just a few hundred or thousand owners. Larger-scale projects can represent more traditional gaming titles with more complex in-game economies while smaller-scale projects simply look more like fine art markets teamed with exclusive social clubs. Some smaller-scale projects have the ambition to eventually become larger-scale ones, but many have capped the number of NFTs in their projects and are designed to be exclusive.\n",
      "In the past 30 days, Axie Infinity did more than $500 million in sales spread across nearly 2 million transactions and over 350,000 buyers. On the flip side, CryptoPunks did $200 million in sales during that same time frame across 484 transactions and 309 buyers.\n",
      "Generally, when I'm talking about some of these big sales from smaller-scale projects with friends of mine, the first thing they mention is how this is probably all just money laundering. While I'd certainly imaginesome of that is happening, that's ultimately a much more boring explanation than my best guess of what's really going on, which is that a group of several thousand investors have separately rationalized irrational investing. They just happen to have chosen to do so through buying pixel art and drawings of animals.\n",
      "While some investors might suggest that a handful of the earliest NFTs hold intrinsic value as historic objects, there are plenty of brand new NFT projects earning ten-million dollar valuations on day one with low amounts of effort and imagination.\n",
      "The Cult of CryptoPunks\n",
      "It's seemingly the result of momentum from awe-struck retail investors entering a market filled with massive amounts of wealth being generated and re-invested by Ethereum millionaires who can massively overpay for deals while pushing the implied value of the objects, the projects, the entire NFT market and the price of Ethereum up concurrently. Most of these investors are also people who have held onto Ethereum through its waves and have grown fundamentally averse to cashing out, meaning they're less likely to sell the NFTs they buy unless they're just trying to buy another more expensive NFT or have been made an offer too good to refuse. As a result, many high-value smaller-scale projects stay liquid on the low-end while fewer sales of the rarer items underpin the massive valuations of the projects and those occasional big buys keep pushing prices higher.\n",
      "All of this babbling of mine is to say, what's happening here is strange. It's also an incredibly large amount of noise mostly coming from a few thousand buyers.\n",
      "But when most investors talk about mainstream adoption and future use cases, they're looking at the creation of more larger-scale projects like Axie and Top Shot which embody many of the technical bells and whistles of crypto economics in more user-friendly packages that can reach the mainstream. NFTs as a concept for driving more complex virtual economies is, indeed, really fascinating, but I don't think there are as many takeaways to draw from billions of dollars flowing into digital art and these smaller-scale projects like CrypToadz as many crypto investors and venture capitalists are trying to convince themselves.\n",
      "Only three NFT platforms out there had more than 10,000 active unique buyers in their community in the past 30 days, and while the successes of platforms like Axie Infinity are definitely worth dissecting, it also seems clear we're in the midst of a speculative frenzy and it's not a very easy time to draw sober conclusions about what all this madness means for the future of the web.\n",

      "Here are a few stories this week that I think you should take a closer look at:\n",
      "Apple probably won't be supporting alternate App Store payments anytime soonApple did their best to convince the press and public that the court's decision in its legal fight with Epic Games was an outright win for Apple, but over the weekend they quietly announced that weeks later they're appealing the decision and asking the courts to put the ordered changes to allow alternative payments inside iOS apps on hold.\n",
      "Apple put on a cool demeanor after this ruling, but it's apparent that there are billions on the line for Apple if this order stands. Therefore delaying its rollout means billions of dollars that aren't going to other payment providers or staying in developer coffers. Epic had already appealed the decision as well, hoping to try for a more favorable ruling, but it's clear that anyone hoping for a speedy resolution will be disappointed -- as is often the case in corporate law.\n",
      "Nintendo reshapes its SaaS ambitionsNintendo has been and probably always will be a bit of an odd big company. They've been resistant to new trends in gaming and when they embrace them, they don't necessarily do a great job capitalizing on them, and yet their mountain of beloved IP allows them chance after chance to get things right. This week, they announced more details on their new annual membership called Nintendo Switch Online+ which, for $50 per year will give gamers a deeper array of content. That's a good deal more than the standard $20 per year for the regular Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but beyond expanded virtual console support for an unannounced array of N64 games, it's not clear what exactly the sell is for consumers.\n",
      "Interestingly, they're launching the service with free access to a major update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It's a play that only works when you're Nintendo and the penetration of your first-party titles is so incredibly high among device-owners (and especially likely subscribers). Nintendo has sold more than 3.4 million copies of the new Animal Crossing title globally.\n",
      "Microsoft pulls LinkedIn from ChinaIt's been a particularly turbulent time for tech companies across China as government regulators crack down and the outlook clouds for big platforms there. This week, Microsoft announced that it's pulling LinkedIn out of China, detailing that LinkedIn was now “facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.” LinkedIn didn't have a huge presence in China so this won't make major waves, but as other American tech giants are forced to make major adjustments to their China strategy, this marks yet another datapoint in the cooling of relations between China and the West.\n",
      "The LinkedIn's of the world don't hold much sway in China, the most curious bit of this is how this regulatory upswing eventually affects Apple which does hold plenty of influence. While officials probably aren't keen to jam them up, the past year has shown that China's regulators have plenty of surprises up their sleeves.\n",

      "Lucas Matney || Revolution, Macro and Micro: Three Ways to Look at a Bitcoin Investment: Investment in cryptocurrencies is all the rage, and bitcoin is clearly the biggest – it has the largest market capitalization , the most infrastructure, the longest track record and is the most decentralized. In previous columns, I’ve stressed the conversations you, as an advisor, will need to have with clients , and how different they are from any conversations you’ve previously had to have about financial planning. Now, we get to talk about three different ways to look at an investment in bitcoin for you and/or your clients: bitcoin as the revolution, bitcoin as a macro investment and bitcoin as a micro investment. I’ll review these three investment theses so you can not only determine why to allocate to bitcoin, but also so you can help your clients better understand the implications of certain news items, media hype and social media posts. This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors , CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday. You and your clients will inevitably read articles and posts from people who fit into all these categories. Having an understanding of where they’re coming from will help you in your practice. (Keep in mind that we can’t necessarily lump every investor or every thesis into one of these three categories.) Bitcoin as the revolution This was really the original “investment” in Bitcoin . Starting shortly after the release of the Bitcoin blockchain’s white paper in 2008, people were mining bitcoin using their home computers and felt like this new currency would be needed sometime in the future. They likely didn’t think it would be worth in the mid-five figures someday, nor did they think of it in institutional investor terms . They held it in private wallets long before we had crypto custodians, and even used it for early transactions – like the infamous bitcoin pizza and Silk Road . Along the way, others have started investing in bitcoin as a hedge against governments, censorship and overly powerful banks. The revolution investment thesis is that, when fiat currency, governments and banks fail or falter we can count on bitcoin. Because bitcoin is completely decentralized, the value isn’t determined and possibly manipulated by a central bank and the transfer can’t be restricted. While this doesn’t seem to be much of a need here in the U.S. and most of the developed world, we can see the value in countries where the government might routinely devalue their own currency to pay down national debt or limit withdrawals from banks. We’ve seen relatively recent examples in Turkey, Argentina and Nicaragua. Story continues If I’m living in one of those countries, or I just don’t trust many of the world leaders, I might own bitcoin and store it offline in a hard wallet. I know that my bitcoin is wherever I am. The revolution investment thesis might not be just because I think I’m going to need bitcoin to trade for goods and services, but because I just want to show my disgust with the current government and banking system. So I’m not going to let them participate in my wealth creation and growth. While this investment thesis in bitcoin might be out of necessity, or out of revolution, its proponents are vigilant about letting the public know they should hold bitcoin. Many of the arguments hinge less on actual macroeconomics driving the dollar value and more on the need to own bitcoin as a hedge against powerful parties and as a political statement. Bitcoin as a macro investment This investment thesis looks at bitcoin as a store of value, and compares the macro economic factors at play in the U.S. and in the world. The thought behind it is that as we see inflation rise due to the increased supply of fiat currency, the value of bitcoin will rise dramatically because bitcoin has a very fixed supply. This is the thesis that many bitcoin investors have been following for years, but it became very popular and well-known in 2020,when legendary macro hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones announced he was allocating some of his portfolio to bitcoin. He was followed shortly by Stanley Druckenmiller and Bill Miller, who are also macro investors. The fiat money printing in the U.S. and in most of the Western world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the potential for inflation, as we have seen trillions more dollars created and dispersed into the economy. Now, we have finally started to see evidence of inflation, which adds fuel to this bitcoin investment thesis. Why would I need to hold bitcoin as an inflation hedge or store of value? Let’s assume I can hypothetically buy a loaf of bread for $1 today. In a year, what if that same loaf of bread cost me $1.05 – which means we had 5% inflation? That happens because we added more dollars, but not more bread, to the system. Therefore, the bread is worth more dollars. If I keep all my money in dollars in the bank (where I’m earning virtually no interest), I can’t buy a loaf of bread in a year with my $1. If I think that will happen, I’ll want my money saved in an asset that also has a limited supply, just like the bread. In the past that asset might have been gold. Now, however, we have an asset with a very limited supply, which is very easy to buy and keep safe (compared to physical gold). I can hold my dollar in bitcoin, and in a year I would assume the price of my bitcoin would go up by at least the same amount as the bread. Therefore, if I need to buy bread, I can sell my bitcoin for at least $1.05. Now, extrapolate that investment over the entire world economy and we can see why these titans of macro investing want to allocate 2%-5% of their holdings to bitcoin. They see inflation coming and they want an asset with finite supply that will increase in value with a decrease in dollar value. When you or your clients read about an increase in inflation leading to a possible increase in value of bitcoin, or about institutions like insurance companies and pensions investing in bitcoin, this is usually the thesis they’re using. Bitcoin as a micro investment This is where most advisors are going to stand with their clients. Your role here is to identify, based partly on the previously mentioned investment theses, how to help your clients allocate to bitcoin. Based on the risk profile, technical prowess and time horizon of your clients, you can assess not only the allocation to bitcoin but also the treatment of the asset – when you trade, how often do you rebalance, etc. Remember that many of those institutions investing in bitcoin for the inflation hedge have a very long or even infinite time horizon. Your clients have a limited time horizon, and each will be different. If your clients are in their early 40s, you’re probably talking to them about the impact inflation will have on their retirement funds. If we also assume you subscribe to the inflation hedge thesis above, bitcoin fits as part of your clients’ retirement planning, at a reasonable allocation based on their risk tolerance. The volatility of bitcoin also allows for an investment when thinking about it for individual clients. Because bitcoin is not correlated and highly liquid, you have the ability to rebalance, possibly quarterly, and provide clients with overall portfolio returns that are more normalized. This bitcoin micro investment thesis is about taking the possible effects on the price of bitcoin and adapting them to individual family portfolios, with more limited time horizons, necessary expenses and traditional assets. Using these investment theses as a lens As you start to learn more about bitcoin, and even to help your clients with allocations to crypto, you will definitely hear from “influencers,” analysts and bitcoin enthusiasts about the reasoning for holding or not holding bitcoin. Your role as the advisor is to understand these main investment theses, and you have the ability to determine how any opinions or analysis affects your clients’ portfolios and financial lives. If you see an influencer or analyst or the news through the lens of one of these investment theses, you’ll be better prepared to have those important conversations with your clients. View comments || After Bitcoins All-Time High, Whats Next?: Bitcoins latest rally to an all-time high price of above $66,000 has given rise to a fresh wave of bullish predictions, with the cryptocurrencys price already more than double where it started the year. Bitcoin breaking its all-time high was a long time coming and had been in the making ever since the asset shed 50% of its value in May, Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy for crypto exchange AAX, told CoinDesk in an interview. He now expects the price to rocket past the $100,000 mark, which a growing number of market analysts are penciling in as their new price target. The Bitcoin blockchain is just 12 years old, and traders in digital markets and on Wall Street are arguably more focused than ever before on the cryptocurrencys movements. So with the price now at unprecedented levels, analysts are adjusting their models and scrutinizing charts to predict what comes next. Just this month alone, bitcoins price has rallied more than 50%, fueled by U.S. regulators first approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETFs) linked to bitcoin futures contracts. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF started trading on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and hauled in $570 million of assets on its first day, while garnering an astounding $1 billion in trading volume, in one of the most successful ETF launches of all time. The markets previous all-time high was $64,889 in April. Since then, market prognosticators saw that mark as the price to beat. Now, with fewer readily available signposts, the outlook might be harder to gauge. What the charts are saying CoinDesks Damanick Dantes wrote Wednesday that $86,000 might represent the next key price target for bulls, based on a reading of price-chart signals. All eyes are set on the $100K mark, but when retail does rush in and more funds open up to bitcoin, including physically backed ETFs, $100K is unlikely to be the end of it, Caselin said. CoinDesk reached out to top market analysts for their insight. Heres where they see the market headed. Story continues Quick tease: Not everyone is bullish. Some analysts say bitcoin will find further gains past the $60,000 mark tougher to come by. Bullish Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Stack Funds: Since the launch of ProShares ETF, there has been a large influx of retail participation. Funding rates for the futures market  a gauge of how willing investors are to pay up for leveraged bets  are rising, but not at the high levels seen earlier in the year. Our next target on spot BTC is $80,000 in the short term, Dibb said. As the market gains further confidence in the medium term, he said, some capital rotation is to be expected from bitcoin into ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, and other alternative digital assets. Ulrik Lykke, founder of ARK36: I wouldnt be surprised if we see bitcoin climb towards $100,000 during Q4 of 2021 or Q1 of 2022. Juan Pellicer, a research analyst at IntoTheBlock: This growth is a phenomenal proxy of the institutional clients that have been adopting bitcoin. Samuel Indyk, an analyst at Investing.com : As has been the case in the past when major events in the cryptocurrency market occur, a correction could be on the cards: For example, when the bitcoin futures contract launched on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 2017, a bear market occurred shortly after, and it took almost three years for the price to recover. What else analysts are saying One risk is that soaring oil and natural gas prices might lead to extra scrutiny over the Bitcoin networks energy usage, according to Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. Thats especially the case as winter approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. Governments might take harsh stances if this winter leads to shortfalls in energy across several countries and that could mess with the hashrate, Moya warned. Hashrate is a gauge of the number of computations sent every second to the Bitcoin network to confirm new data blocks and transactions. || JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says Bitcoin regulation is inevitable: Jamie Dimon , w ho heads the largest bank in the United States, said that Bitcoin needs to be regulated by the government. The JPMorgan Chase CEO told Axios that Bitcoin, which is the flagship cryptocurrency and has seen explosive growth since its inception, is destined for increased government scrutiny. “If people are using it for tax avoidance and sex trafficking and ransomware, it’s going to be regulated, whether you like it or not. So it’s not a moral statement. It’s a factual statement,” he said during an interview in Washington, D.C. CRYPTO PRICES SKYROCKET AFTER EL SALVADOR BEGINS HARVESTING VOLCANO POWER TO MINE FOR BITCOIN Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have faced increased regulation in recent months, with China initiating the harshest crackdowns. Last month, the People’s Bank of China said all cryptocurrency transactions are outlawed and that services offering trading in cryptocurrencies and overseas cryptocurrency exchanges are banned. While Dimon sees Bitcoin sticking around in the global markets, he said he has “always believed it’ll be made illegal someplace, like China made it illegal, so I think it’s a little bit of fool’s gold.” Dimon has long been one of Wall Street’s biggest skeptics of cryptocurrency. Dimon, testifying before Congress earlier this year, expressed his own thoughts on the volatile new asset class, which he said is not comparable to gold or fiat currencies: “Buyers beware.” “My own personal advice to people is: stay away from it. That does not mean the clients don't want it,” Dimon said. “This goes back to how you have to run a business. I don't smoke marijuana, but if you make it nationally legal, I'm not going to stop our people from banking it.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Bitcoin, now worth almost $49,000 per coin, has had a mercurial year. It climbed from $29,000 on New Year’s Day to more than $63,000 in April before falling back down to about $29,000 in late July.

Interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies reached a fever pitch in 2020 and 2021, as prices skyrocketed and crypto in general became a topic in the mainstream news.

      "Although some Bitcoin holders use the crypto primarily for payment purposes, many others own Bitcoin to generate profits. There are three primary ways that you could earn money in Bitcoin.\n",
      "Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, is one of the most volatile asset classes available. This makes it difficult for long-term holders to maintain their positions, as the crypto often makes double-digit percentage moves in a single day. For traders, however, this type of volatility is ideal. By quickly moving in and out of Bitcoin, you can rapidly book profits and jump out before the trend turns. If you’re an agile trader and can snag a gain of just 5% per week, that amounts to an annual return in excess of 250%.\n",

      "Although it can be emotionally difficult to hold a position in Bitcoin over the long run, these are the types of investors who have posted the most impressive gains. For example, if you invested just $1 in 2010 when Bitcoin traded at about $0.0008,you could have bought about 1,250 Bitcoin. Over 10 years later, at Bitcoin’s July 10 price of about $33,374,your initial $1 investment would be worth about $41.7 million. If you had managed to sell out at Bitcoin’s all-time high of nearly $65,000,you could have pocketed about $81.25 million. While you shouldn’t expect these types of stratospheric gains, at least historically, Bitcoin has thus far provided long-term holders with spectacular gains.\n",

      "If you’d rather work for your Bitcoin than invest in it or trade it, perhaps Bitcoin mining is for you. Although the details can get a bit complicated, the bottom line is that Bitcoin miners are the ones who produce additional Bitcoin by recording transactions in the blockchain ledger. Every time they solve the complex algorithm that unlocks blockchain ledger transactions, they’re paid with a specified amount of Bitcoin. Currently, that reward is 6.25 Bitcoin, although this number gets halved about every four years.Understand that successfully mining Bitcoin typically requires the use of massive computer server farms and enormous amounts of electricity, so it isn’t for everyone.\n",

      "Just as investors can make money in Bitcoin, they can also lose it. Here are some of the most common ways that you might lose money in Bitcoin.\n",
      "Trading can lead to big gains in Bitcoin, but it’s not without risk. In fact, the movements in the price of Bitcoin are so great that it’s very easy for even experienced traders to get whipsawed and lose a lot of money. Trading Bitcoin poorly is therefore probably the easiest way to lose money in Bitcoin. If you decide to go this route, you might want to take some practice runs on websites that offer simulated trading, or begin with a small amount at first.\n",

      "Hackers may be the greatest risk to Bitcoin holders, especially as the cryptocurrency gains widespread acceptance. When you own Bitcoin, you hold it in an electronic wallet that only you can access, at least theoretically. But hackers have shown the ability to tap into Bitcoin wallets, and they are only going to get more proficient as the years go by. Once a hacker has access to your Bitcoin wallet, he or she can drain you of all your cryptocurrency, just like someone who has your debit card can take all of your cash. However, if you lose your crypto to a hacker, no bank is going to replace it for you.\n",
