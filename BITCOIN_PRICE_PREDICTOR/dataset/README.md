# Bitcoin Price Prediction Dataset with News Summaries: A Multi-Modal Financial Forecasting Research Dataset

## Abstract

This repository presents a novel multimodal dataset that integrates quantitative financial time series data with qualitative news sentiment analysis for Bitcoin price prediction research. The dataset represents a significant contribution to the intersection of natural language processing and financial forecasting, providing researchers with a comprehensive framework for developing and evaluating hybrid prediction models that leverage both technical market indicators and news-driven sentiment analysis.

## Research Motivation

Traditional cryptocurrency price prediction models rely primarily on technical analysis or fundamental analysis in isolation. This dataset addresses the critical research gap by providing a unified framework that combines:

1. **Temporal Price Dynamics**: High-frequency price movements with technical indicators
2. **Information-Theoretic News Analysis**: Structured sentiment and event extraction from news sources
3. **Macroeconomic Context**: Correlation with traditional financial instruments (Gold, Oil)
4. **Multi-Horizon Forecasting**: Supporting both short-term trading and medium-term investment strategies

This approach enables researchers to investigate the complex interdependencies between market psychology (reflected in news sentiment) and quantitative price movements, addressing fundamental questions in behavioral finance and algorithmic trading.

## Dataset Overview

### Research Framework

This dataset implements a novel **Temporal-Contextual Prediction Framework** that addresses key challenges in financial time series forecasting:

**Problem Definition**: Given a sequence of historical price data P(t-60:t) and corresponding news context N(t), predict future price trajectory P(t+1:t+10) along with actionable trading signals.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

```
f: (P(t-60:t), N(t), M(t)) → (P̂(t+1:t+10), A(t), C(t))
```

Where:

- P(t) = Price vector including OHLCV data
- N(t) = News feature vector (sentiment, events, drivers)
- M(t) = Macroeconomic context (Gold, Oil prices)
- P̂ = Predicted price sequence
- A(t) = Trading action {BUY, SELL, HOLD}
- C(t) = Confidence score [0,1]

### Dataset Components

1. **Temporal Price Dynamics**:

   - 6+ years of daily Bitcoin prices (2018-2024)
   - Technical indicators derived from price action
   - Volatility clustering and trend analysis metrics

2. **Structured News Intelligence**:

   - Daily aggregated news summaries with sentiment scoring
   - Event extraction and categorization
   - Market impact assessment and price driver identification

3. **Macroeconomic Integration**:

   - Gold and Oil price correlation analysis
   - Traditional market context for cryptocurrency movements

4. **Supervised Learning Targets**:
   - 10-day price forecasting horizons
   - Risk-adjusted trading signals with confidence intervals
   - Stop-loss and take-profit level recommendations

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Data Sources

**1. Financial Time Series Data**

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library)
- **Instrument**: BTC-USD (Bitcoin to US Dollar)
- **Temporal Coverage**: January 1, 2018 - May 31, 2024 (2,343 days)
- **Frequency**: Daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- **Data Quality**: 99.8% completeness with automated gap detection

**2. News Intelligence Pipeline**

- **Source**: Proprietary news aggregation system
- **Coverage**: 100+ cryptocurrency news sources

### Data Quality Assurance

**Temporal Alignment Protocol**:

```python
# Pseudo-code for data synchronization
aligned_data = temporal_align(
    price_data=btc_prices,
    news_data=news_summaries,
    macro_data=[gold_prices, oil_prices],
    alignment_method="forward_fill",
    max_gap_days=3
)
```

**Quality Metrics**:

- Price data completeness: 99.8%
- News coverage ratio: 87.3% of trading days
- Macro data availability: 98.1%
- Cross-correlation validation: R² > 0.95 with external sources

## Dataset Creation Process

The `create_prediction_dataset_with_summaries_main_DS.ipynb` notebook follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**:

   - Downloads historical Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance
   - Loads Gold and Oil prices as macroeconomic context
   - Imports daily news summaries from local JSON files

2. **Data Processing**:

   - Aligns price data with news summaries by date
   - Calculates 60-day historical price windows and 10-day target windows
   - Extracts technical indicators (volatility, returns, price ranges)
   - Processes news summaries into structured format

3. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Calculates price-based technical indicators
   - Extracts sentiment, key events, and market impact from news
   - Combines price, technical, and news data into unified samples

4. **Training Data Preparation**:

   - Formats data into instruction-based samples for LLM fine-tuning
   - Creates input prompts with technical and news information
   - Generates corresponding output targets in JSON format

5. **Dataset Validation**:
   - Verifies data completeness and quality
   - Analyzes news coverage and fills gaps where necessary
   - Ensures consistent format across all samples
