Analyze the provided news and historical price data to make your forecast.\\n\\n**Today\\'s Key News:**\\n[\\'Tax reform has had a major impact on the current earnings season, as just about every company stands to see changes to its tax situation as a result of new rules on foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates.Aflac(NYSE: AFL)is in an unusual situation, because even though most U.S. investors know the company as a provider of supplemental insurance products to workers throughout the country,Aflac gets most of its revenue from its Japanese business. That has dramatic implications for how new tax laws will affect the insurer in 2018 and beyond.\\\\nComing into Wednesday\\\\\\'s fourth-quarter financial report, Aflac investors believed that the company\\\\\\'s top line would take a big hit, but earnings were expected to be solid. The insurer got a nice boost from tax reform, and even when you take out that one-time impact, solid bottom-line performance on an adjusted basis set the stage for a good start in 2018. Let\\\\\\'s look more closely at Aflac and how it did to finish 2017.\\\\nImage source: Aflac.\\\\nAflac\\\\\\'s fourth-quarter results were mixed, as most shareholders had expected. Revenue plunged 9% to $5.42 billion, but that was slightly less dramatic than the roughly 10% decline that most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income more than tripled to $2.4 billion. After adjusting for special items, adjusted operating earnings of $1.63 per share were $0.08 better than the consensus among investors.\\\\nTax reform was a huge part of the reason Aflac\\\\\\'s bottom line rose so much. The company posted a $1.7 billion estimated benefit from tax reform, stemming in large part from expected lower tax rates on repatriated earnings from its Japanese unit. Aflac has been unusual in that it has typically brought back some capital from its overseas business even in the face of the higher tax rates that prevailed under previous law.\\\\nThe weaker yen again played a role in hurting Aflac\\\\\\'s revenue. The yen fell about 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-earlier period, with the dollar rising from 109.10 yen to 112.98 yen over that span. Aflac blamed the yen for $0.03 per share in operating earnings, which was a smaller impact than theinsurer has seen in previous periods.\\\\nAflac\\\\\\'s restructuring of its Japanese operations continued to weigh on performance as well. Local-currency premium income fell 3.3% in the quarter, with the insurer\\\\\\'s anticipated pullback from first-sector savings products within Japan weighing on the company\\\\\\'s ability to pick up new business in the more lucrative third-sector cancer, medical, and income support product category. New annualized premium sales were down 8% in local terms, and it took a rise in net investment income to offset some of the falling fundamental performance for the Japanese unit.\\\\nIn the U.S., Aflac managed to post a 2% rise in premium income and total revenue. Pretax operating earnings climbed almost 10%, as better margin reflected cost controls. Total new annualized premium sales climbed almost 7% in the segment during the quarter.\\\\nCEO Daniel Amos kept his comments relatively simple. \"We are pleased with the company\\\\\\'s overall performance for the year,\" Amos said, and he pointed to tax reform in giving Aflac \"an opportunity to accelerate and increase our investments in initiatives that reflect our company values and objectives.\" The CEO is also optimistic about its future, noting that challenges in Japan early in the year should give way to better performance in the second half, while the U.S. market should keep producing solid growth.\\\\nIn particular, Aflac intends to spend about $250 million on U.S. operations over the next three to five years. This should come in the form expanded employee benefits, training programs, and investment in technology and digital business initiatives. The insurer\\\\\\'s guidance for 2018 was also favorable. Aflac expects earnings of between $7.45 and $7.75 per share, which compared favorably to the $7.50 per share consensus forecast among those following the stock.\\\\nAflac also took the unusual move of announcing another big boost to its quarterly dividend. The first-quarter payout of $0.53 per share will be 16% higher than its newly raised dividend just last quarter. Further stock repurchases of between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018 should also help to return capital to shareholders effectively.\\\\nAflac investors didn\\\\\\'t seem surprised by the news, and the stock was close to unchanged in after-hours trading following the announcement. Some investors were likely waiting for more clarity on sometroubling allegations that the insurer has had to facein the past week. Yet from a fundamental business standpoint, with benefits from tax reform now in the books, Aflac has the opportunity to make the most of its trans-Pacific reach and tap into both of its target markets as effectively as it can.\\\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

Most people understand that the earlier they take Social Security, the less they\\'ll get. But the mechanics of how your full retirement age interacts with provisions that reduce early benefits, but increase monthly checks if you take them later, aren\\'t entirely clear to everyone in or nearing retirement.\\nIf you want to get the biggest possible monthly benefits from Social Security, you have to take advantage of the program\\'sdelayed retirement credits. Yet under current law, younger people\\'s ability to claim delayed retirement credits is being phased down, and future moves could limit credits even further.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe Social Security Administration designed delayed retirement credits to augment benefits for those who chose to wait beyond full retirement age before claiming their Social Security. In order to figure out how big your delayed retirement credit will be, you\\'ll need to follow this four-step process:\\n• Figure out how much your primary insurance amount would be. That\\'s the amount you would receive if you took your Social Security benefits right at your full retirement age.\\n• Look up what your full retirement age is. That age is 66 for those who are turning 66 in 2018 or who have done so in recent years.\\n• Decide how many months after your full retirement age you intend to start taking Social Security.\\n• For each month that you wait after full retirement age, increase your primary insurance amount by two-thirds of a percent.\\nAn example can help you see how this works. Say that your full retirement age is 66 and your earnings history would produce a $1,500 primary insurance amount. If you take Social Security right at 66, you\\'ll get $1,500 monthly. But say you want to wait until you turn 68. In that case, you\\'d take the number of months after your full retirement age, which is 24 months. Multiply 24 by two-thirds of a percent, and you\\'ll get 16%.\\nDoing the math, 16% of $1,500 is $240, so your delayed retirement credit will be $240, and you\\'ll get a total of $1,740 per month -- valued in today\\'s dollars and subject to future inflation -- if you wait two years before claiming your benefits. Wait until the maximum age of 70 -- beyond which no further delayed retirement credits are available -- and you\\'d get a 32% bump, to $1,980 per month.\\nDelayed retirement credits are available only to worker benefits under Social Security. Spousal benefits don\\'t qualify, so there\\'s no reason for a spouse intending to receive only spousal benefits to wait beyond full retirement age before making a claim and getting those monthly payments started. However, if a spouse could claim either spousal benefitsorwork benefits on the spouse\\'s own earnings history, then there could be reasons to hold off filing beyond full retirement age under current law.\\nAs you saw above, the largest number of delayed retirement credits for those who are reaching full retirement age now is 48 months, or a 32% increase to benefit amounts. That\\'s because the age beyond which new delayed retirement credits are no longer available is set at 70, regardless of what the full retirement age is.\\nChanges made to the Social Security program in the early 1980sraised the full retirement age. Early retirees are finding now that their full retirement age is higher than 66, with those turning 62 in 2018 having a full retirement age of 66 and four months. That will go up gradually over the next several years, topping out at 67 for those who were born in 1960 or later.\\nWhat that means for those considering delayed retirement credits is that there will be fewer of them to claim. If your full retirement age is 67, then the largest number of credits you can get is 36 months, because that\\'s the length of time between full retirement age and reaching age 70. That makes the maximum boost to your benefits 24% instead of 32%, working out to a loss of $120 in potential delayed retirement credits on a monthly basis.\\nDespite not being able to get as many delayed retirement credits, those who have a while left before retiring still should think about the ideal time to claim their benefits and consider waiting if they can. Even as the reward for waiting goes down, the penalty for claiming early is also going up. The net impact still makes it smart to wait if you want your monthly check to be as big as it can be.\\nFiguring out when to take Social Security has personal aspects to it, but you\\'ll also want to consider the financial implications. Understanding the ins and outs of delayed retirement credits will help you make a smarter choice.\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

      "- Contextual Past News Article: By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar nudged down on Monday, pulling back from six-month peaks against the yen as a U.S. debt ceiling deal lifted risk appetite in world markets and dented the greenback's safe-haven appeal. U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday finalised a budget agreement with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling until Jan. 1, 2025, and said the deal was ready to move to Congress for a vote. Having briefly touched a six-month high of 140.91 yen during Asia trade, the dollar drifted lower and was last down almost a third of a percent at 140.17 yen. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. unit's value against a basket of other major currencies, was also a touch softer around 104.23 but not far from last week's two-month peaks. The pull-back in the safe-haven dollar came as world stocks rallied on the positive news from Washington, although trade was generally subdued with parts of Europe, including Britain, on holiday along with the United States. \"An initial risk-on reaction is likely as the cloud of U.S. default has retreated,\" said Charu Chanana, a market strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. \"But focus will quickly turn to the fact that getting the deal is only a step in the process and an agreement from both the House and Senate by June 5 is still a big ask.\" The agreement would suspend the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, and cap spending in the 2024 and 2025 budgets. SPAIN ELECTION In Europe, the euro slipped 0.2% to $1.0709, showing little immediate reaction to news of a snap election in Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday polling would take place on July 23 after his left-wing coalition government suffered heavy losses in regional ballots on Sunday. Upbeat world sentiment pushed the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars off last week's six-month lows. The Aussie rose 0.35% to $0.6541, while the kiwi edged 0.2% higher to $0.6058. Story continues \"We've got a risk-positive response so far to the debt deal news,\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. \"Obviously there's still the need to get this debt deal over the line, but I think markets are happy to travel on the presumption that it will get done before the new X-date.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday said the government would default if Congress did not increase the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling by June 5, having previously said a default could happen as early as June 1. Talk that the U.S. rate hiking cycle may not be over as soon as hoped given signs of economic strength have bolstered the dollar and could support the currency even as U.S. debt ceiling worries abate. The dollar was on course for a monthly gain of about 3% against the yen. The dollar index has gained 2.5% in May. Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in April and inflation picked up, adding to signs of a still-resilient economy. Money markets price in a roughly 62% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by 25 basis points in June, versus a roughly 26% chance a week ago. Elsewhere, the Turkish lira touched a record low at 20.10 per dollar after President Tayyip Erdogan secured victory in the country's presidential election on Sunday, extending his increasingly authoritarian rule into a third decade. Bitcoin, meanwhile, slipped 0.5% to $27,932, down from a three-week high hit earlier on.

      "['As the race for the White House heats up, Democratic candidate for U.S. president Robert Kennedy Jr, has come out as a proponent of Bitcoin, and says he has proven that commitment by buying 14 Bitcoin last May. In a Wednesday Twitter Spaces interview with crypto investor and podcaster Scott Melker, Kennedy called Bitcoin the currency of freedom, and said he decided to become a crypto investor after he was chided by media outlets for promoting Bitcoin but didn’t own any. “I bought two Bitcoin for each of my seven children,” Kennedy said, noting he made the move \"right after\" his appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in May. “Now I’m a Bitcoin owner, and I’m sure they’ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn’t put my money where my mouth is.” Kennedy and Melker also discussed how banks can shut down customer bank accounts without warning, and suggested political pressure may be behind the closure of the bank account of Joseph Mercola, described by the New York Times as \"the most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation online.\" Chase bank has shut down our business bank accounts along with the accounts of my CEO and CFO, as well as their family members (including spouse and child). They\\'ve refused to provide any reason for doing so, the oldest account has been active for 18 years.… — Dr. Joseph Mercola (@mercola) July 25, 2023 \"Here we have a powerful banking interest that that has received all kinds of federal government support and it\\'s utterly dependent on its on its relationship with the Fed and the federal government and it is shutting down one of its customers for political speech,\" Kennedy said. \"I think that incident alone should be one that all of us should be terrified about, and and it makes the the move toward Bitcoin, all the more important.\" Story continues Crypto Booster Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Bought Bitcoin Despite Recent Claim: Report During the annual conference held in Miami, Florida, Kennedy said covid-19 restriction led him to Bitcoin, and he claimed to be the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin donations through the Lightning Network. But he also said that he didn\\'t own any, and wasn\\'t there to give investment advice. Currently, the price of a Bitcoin is $29,330 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of his speech at Bitcoin 2023, the price of a Bitcoin stood around $27,128. If Kennedy’s claims are true, the Kennedy Bitcoin treasury would be worth around $400,000 today. Earlier this month, a financial disclosure document obtained by CNBC showed Kennedy’s Family held (at the time) between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin. His conference address established his strong alignment with so-called digital gold. “When I witnessed this cataclysm—this devastating use of government repression—I realized for the first time how free money is as important to freedom as free expression,” Kennedy said. Kennedy added that the many environmental claims about Bitcoin are unfounded. “I believe that the environmental arguments against Bitcoin are a smokescreen to obscure the real motives for suppressing Bitcoin,” he said, citing the massive cost of endless wars and environmentally destructive projects.

Brent Xu, the CEO and co-founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, told CoinDesk in an email that the status quo is likely to continue. “Bitcoin barely budged following the Federal Reserve’s most recent rate hike, underscoring that this period of heightened rates has pretty much been priced in,\" Xu wrote. \"This is certainly indicative of BTC resilience and indeed resilience for the broader digital asset market.

      "- Contextual Past News Article: Current Florida Governor and GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis continued his campaign against central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ), vowing a ban if he were elected president. “Done, dead, not happening in this country,” said DeSantis at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa last Friday. “If I am the president, on day one, we will nix central bank digital currency.” DeSantis has been an outspoken critic of CDBDs for allowing “government-sanctioned surveillance,” and in March signed a bill to prohibit the use of a national CBDC as money within Florida. As for the broader subject of crypto, he’s been far more supportive, previously calling its use a question of civil liberty and describing bitcoin ( BTC ) as a “threat to the current regime.” Central bank digital currencies, which are a tokenized form of a country’s fiat currency issued by the government, are becoming a growing wedge between political sides in the U.S., with the GOP, broadly speaking, not in favor, and the Democrats so far mostly silent on the subject.

Analyze the provided news and historical price data to make your forecast.\\n\\n**Today\\'s Key News:**\\n[\\'Tax reform has had a major impact on the current earnings season, as just about every company stands to see changes to its tax situation as a result of new rules on foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates.Aflac(NYSE: AFL)is in an unusual situation, because even though most U.S. investors know the company as a provider of supplemental insurance products to workers throughout the country,Aflac gets most of its revenue from its Japanese business. That has dramatic implications for how new tax laws will affect the insurer in 2018 and beyond.\\\\nComing into Wednesday\\\\\\'s fourth-quarter financial report, Aflac investors believed that the company\\\\\\'s top line would take a big hit, but earnings were expected to be solid. The insurer got a nice boost from tax reform, and even when you take out that one-time impact, solid bottom-line performance on an adjusted basis set the stage for a good start in 2018. Let\\\\\\'s look more closely at Aflac and how it did to finish 2017.\\\\nImage source: Aflac.\\\\nAflac\\\\\\'s fourth-quarter results were mixed, as most shareholders had expected. Revenue plunged 9% to $5.42 billion, but that was slightly less dramatic than the roughly 10% decline that most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income more than tripled to $2.4 billion. After adjusting for special items, adjusted operating earnings of $1.63 per share were $0.08 better than the consensus among investors.\\\\nTax reform was a huge part of the reason Aflac\\\\\\'s bottom line rose so much. The company posted a $1.7 billion estimated benefit from tax reform, stemming in large part from expected lower tax rates on repatriated earnings from its Japanese unit. Aflac has been unusual in that it has typically brought back some capital from its overseas business even in the face of the higher tax rates that prevailed under previous law.\\\\nThe weaker yen again played a role in hurting Aflac\\\\\\'s revenue. The yen fell about 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-earlier period, with the dollar rising from 109.10 yen to 112.98 yen over that span. Aflac blamed the yen for $0.03 per share in operating earnings, which was a smaller impact than theinsurer has seen in previous periods.\\\\nAflac\\\\\\'s restructuring of its Japanese operations continued to weigh on performance as well. Local-currency premium income fell 3.3% in the quarter, with the insurer\\\\\\'s anticipated pullback from first-sector savings products within Japan weighing on the company\\\\\\'s ability to pick up new business in the more lucrative third-sector cancer, medical, and income support product category. New annualized premium sales were down 8% in local terms, and it took a rise in net investment income to offset some of the falling fundamental performance for the Japanese unit.\\\\nIn the U.S., Aflac managed to post a 2% rise in premium income and total revenue. Pretax operating earnings climbed almost 10%, as better margin reflected cost controls. Total new annualized premium sales climbed almost 7% in the segment during the quarter.\\\\nCEO Daniel Amos kept his comments relatively simple. \"We are pleased with the company\\\\\\'s overall performance for the year,\" Amos said, and he pointed to tax reform in giving Aflac \"an opportunity to accelerate and increase our investments in initiatives that reflect our company values and objectives.\" The CEO is also optimistic about its future, noting that challenges in Japan early in the year should give way to better performance in the second half, while the U.S. market should keep producing solid growth.\\\\nIn particular, Aflac intends to spend about $250 million on U.S. operations over the next three to five years. This should come in the form expanded employee benefits, training programs, and investment in technology and digital business initiatives. The insurer\\\\\\'s guidance for 2018 was also favorable. Aflac expects earnings of between $7.45 and $7.75 per share, which compared favorably to the $7.50 per share consensus forecast among those following the stock.\\\\nAflac also took the unusual move of announcing another big boost to its quarterly dividend. The first-quarter payout of $0.53 per share will be 16% higher than its newly raised dividend just last quarter. Further stock repurchases of between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018 should also help to return capital to shareholders effectively.\\\\nAflac investors didn\\\\\\'t seem surprised by the news, and the stock was close to unchanged in after-hours trading following the announcement. Some investors were likely waiting for more clarity on sometroubling allegations that the insurer has had to facein the past week. Yet from a fundamental business standpoint, with benefits from tax reform now in the books, Aflac has the opportunity to make the most of its trans-Pacific reach and tap into both of its target markets as effectively as it can.\\\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

In the U.S., Aflac managed to post a 2% rise in premium income and total revenue. Pretax operating earnings climbed almost 10%, as better margin reflected cost controls. Total new annualized premium sales climbed almost 7% in the segment during the quarter. Can Aflac keep quacking? CEO Daniel Amos kept his comments relatively simple. \"We are pleased with the company\\\\\\'s overall performance for the year,\" Amos said, and he pointed to tax reform in giving Aflac \"an opportunity to accelerate and increase our investments in initiatives that reflect our company values and objectives.\" The CEO is also optimistic about its future, noting that challenges in Japan early in the year should give way to better performance in the second half, while the U.S. market should keep producing solid growth. In particular, Aflac intends to spend about $250 million on U.S. operations over the next three to five years. This should come in the form expanded employee benefits, training programs, and investment in technology and digital business initiatives. The insurer\\\\\\'s guidance for 2018 was also favorable. Aflac expects earnings of between $7.45 and $7.75 per share, which compared favorably to the $7.50 per share consensus forecast among those following the stock. Aflac also took the unusual move of announcing another big boost to its quarterly dividend. The first-quarter payout of $0.53 per share will be 16% higher than its newly raised dividend just last quarter. Further stock repurchases of between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018 should also help to return capital to shareholders effectively. Aflac investors didn\\\\\\'t seem surprised by the news, and the stock was close to unchanged in after-hours trading following the announcement.

Most people understand that the earlier they take Social Security, the less they\\'ll get. But the mechanics of how your full retirement age interacts with provisions that reduce early benefits, but increase monthly checks if you take them later, aren\\'t entirely clear to everyone in or nearing retirement.\\nIf you want to get the biggest possible monthly benefits from Social Security, you have to take advantage of the program\\'sdelayed retirement credits. Yet under current law, younger people\\'s ability to claim delayed retirement credits is being phased down, and future moves could limit credits even further.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe Social Security Administration designed delayed retirement credits to augment benefits for those who chose to wait beyond full retirement age before claiming their Social Security. In order to figure out how big your delayed retirement credit will be, you\\'ll need to follow this four-step process:\\n• Figure out how much your primary insurance amount would be. That\\'s the amount you would receive if you took your Social Security benefits right at your full retirement age.\\n• Look up what your full retirement age is. That age is 66 for those who are turning 66 in 2018 or who have done so in recent years.\\n• Decide how many months after your full retirement age you intend to start taking Social Security.\\n• For each month that you wait after full retirement age, increase your primary insurance amount by two-thirds of a percent.\\nAn example can help you see how this works. Say that your full retirement age is 66 and your earnings history would produce a $1,500 primary insurance amount. If you take Social Security right at 66, you\\'ll get $1,500 monthly. But say you want to wait until you turn 68. In that case, you\\'d take the number of months after your full retirement age, which is 24 months. Multiply 24 by two-thirds of a percent, and you\\'ll get 16%.\\nDoing the math, 16% of $1,500 is $240, so your delayed retirement credit will be $240, and you\\'ll get a total of $1,740 per month -- valued in today\\'s dollars and subject to future inflation -- if you wait two years before claiming your benefits. Wait until the maximum age of 70 -- beyond which no further delayed retirement credits are available -- and you\\'d get a 32% bump, to $1,980 per month.\\nDelayed retirement credits are available only to worker benefits under Social Security. Spousal benefits don\\'t qualify, so there\\'s no reason for a spouse intending to receive only spousal benefits to wait beyond full retirement age before making a claim and getting those monthly payments started. However, if a spouse could claim either spousal benefitsorwork benefits on the spouse\\'s own earnings history, then there could be reasons to hold off filing beyond full retirement age under current law.\\nAs you saw above, the largest number of delayed retirement credits for those who are reaching full retirement age now is 48 months, or a 32% increase to benefit amounts. That\\'s because the age beyond which new delayed retirement credits are no longer available is set at 70, regardless of what the full retirement age is.\\nChanges made to the Social Security program in the early 1980sraised the full retirement age. Early retirees are finding now that their full retirement age is higher than 66, with those turning 62 in 2018 having a full retirement age of 66 and four months. That will go up gradually over the next several years, topping out at 67 for those who were born in 1960 or later.\\nWhat that means for those considering delayed retirement credits is that there will be fewer of them to claim. If your full retirement age is 67, then the largest number of credits you can get is 36 months, because that\\'s the length of time between full retirement age and reaching age 70. That makes the maximum boost to your benefits 24% instead of 32%, working out to a loss of $120 in potential delayed retirement credits on a monthly basis.\\nDespite not being able to get as many delayed retirement credits, those who have a while left before retiring still should think about the ideal time to claim their benefits and consider waiting if they can. Even as the reward for waiting goes down, the penalty for claiming early is also going up. The net impact still makes it smart to wait if you want your monthly check to be as big as it can be.\\nFiguring out when to take Social Security has personal aspects to it, but you\\'ll also want to consider the financial implications. Understanding the ins and outs of delayed retirement credits will help you make a smarter choice.\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

That has dramatic implications for how new tax laws will affect the insurer in 2018 and beyond.\\\\nComing into Wednesday\\\\\\'s fourth-quarter financial report, Aflac investors believed that the company\\\\\\'s top line would take a big hit, but earnings were expected to be solid. The insurer got a nice boost from tax reform, and even when you take out that one-time impact, solid bottom-line performance on an adjusted basis set the stage for a good start in 2018. Let\\\\\\'s look more closely at Aflac and how it did to finish 2017.\\\\nImage source: Aflac.\\\\nAflac\\\\\\'s fourth-quarter results were mixed, as most shareholders had expected. Revenue plunged 9% to $5.42 billion, but that was slightly less dramatic than the roughly 10% decline that most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income more than tripled to $2.4 billion. After adjusting for special items, adjusted operating earnings of $1.63 per share were $0.08 better than the consensus among investors.\\\\nTax reform was a huge part of the reason Aflac\\\\\\'s bottom line rose so much. The company posted a $1.7 billion estimated benefit from tax reform, stemming in large part from expected lower tax rates on repatriated earnings from its Japanese unit. Aflac has been unusual in that it has typically brought back some capital from its overseas business even in the face of the higher tax rates that prevailed under previous law.\\\\nThe weaker yen again played a role in hurting Aflac\\\\\\'s revenue. The yen fell about 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-earlier period, with the dollar rising from 109.10 yen to 112.98 yen over that span. Aflac blamed the yen for $0.03 per share in operating earnings, which was a smaller impact than theinsurer has seen in previous periods.\\\\nAflac\\\\\\'s restructuring of its Japanese operations continued to weigh on performance as well. Local-currency premium income fell 3.3% in the quarter, with the insurer\\\\\\'s anticipated pullback from first-sector savings products within Japan weighing on the company\\\\\\'s ability to pick up new business in the more lucrative third-sector cancer, medical, and income support product category. New annualized premium sales were down 8% in local terms, and it took a rise in net investment income to offset some of the falling fundamental performance for the Japanese unit.\\\\nIn the U.S., Aflac managed to post a 2% rise in premium income and total revenue. Pretax operating earnings climbed almost 10%, as better margin reflected cost controls. Total new annualized premium sales climbed almost 7% in the segment during the quarter.\\\\nCEO Daniel Amos kept his comments relatively simple. \"We are pleased with the company\\\\\\'s overall performance for the year,\" Amos said, and he pointed to tax reform in giving Aflac \"an opportunity to accelerate and increase our investments in initiatives that reflect our company values and objectives.\" The CEO is also optimistic about its future, noting that challenges in Japan early in the year should give way to better performance in the second half, while the U.S. market should keep producing solid growth.\\\\nIn particular, Aflac intends to spend about $250 million on U.S. operations over the next three to five years. This should come in the form expanded employee benefits, training programs, and investment in technology and digital business initiatives. The insurer\\\\\\'s guidance for 2018 was also favorable. Aflac expects earnings of between $7.45 and $7.75 per share, which compared favorably to the $7.50 per share consensus forecast among those following the stock.\\\\nAflac also took the unusual move of announcing another big boost to its quarterly dividend. The first-quarter payout of $0.53 per share will be 16% higher than its newly raised dividend just last quarter.

Some investors were likely waiting for more clarity on sometroubling allegations that the insurer has had to facein the past week.

Most people understand that the earlier they take Social Security, the less they\\'ll get. But the mechanics of how your full retirement age interacts with provisions that reduce early benefits, but increase monthly checks if you take them later, aren\\'t entirely clear to everyone in or nearing retirement.\\nIf you want to get the biggest possible monthly benefits from Social Security, you have to take advantage of the program\\'sdelayed retirement credits. Yet under current law, younger people\\'s ability to claim delayed retirement credits is being phased down, and future moves could limit credits even further.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe Social Security Administration designed delayed retirement credits to augment benefits for those who chose to wait beyond full retirement age before claiming their Social Security. In order to figure out how big your delayed retirement credit will be, you\\'ll need to follow this four-step process:\\n• Figure out how much your primary insurance amount would be. That\\'s the amount you would receive if you took your Social Security benefits right at your full retirement age.\\n• Look up what your full retirement age is. That age is 66 for those who are turning 66 in 2018 or who have done so in recent years.\\n• Decide how many months after your full retirement age you intend to start taking Social Security.\\n• For each month that you wait after full retirement age, increase your primary insurance amount by two-thirds of a percent.\\nAn example can help you see how this works. Say that your full retirement age is 66 and your earnings history would produce a $1,500 primary insurance amount. If you take Social Security right at 66, you\\'ll get $1,500 monthly. But say you want to wait until you turn 68. In that case, you\\'d take the number of months after your full retirement age, which is 24 months. Multiply 24 by two-thirds of a percent, and you\\'ll get 16%.\\nDoing the math, 16% of $1,500 is $240, so your delayed retirement credit will be $240, and you\\'ll get a total of $1,740 per month -- valued in today\\'s dollars and subject to future inflation -- if you wait two years before claiming your benefits. Wait until the maximum age of 70 -- beyond which no further delayed retirement credits are available -- and you\\'d get a 32% bump, to $1,980 per month.\\nDelayed retirement credits are available only to worker benefits under Social Security. Spousal benefits don\\'t qualify, so there\\'s no reason for a spouse intending to receive only spousal benefits to wait beyond full retirement age before making a claim and getting those monthly payments started. However, if a spouse could claim either spousal benefitsorwork benefits on the spouse\\'s own earnings history, then there could be reasons to hold off filing beyond full retirement age under current law.\\nAs you saw above, the largest number of delayed retirement credits for those who are reaching full retirement age now is 48 months, or a 32% increase to benefit amounts. That\\'s because the age beyond which new delayed retirement credits are no longer available is set at 70, regardless of what the full retirement age is.\\nChanges made to the Social Security program in the early 1980sraised the full retirement age. Early retirees are finding now that their full retirement age is higher than 66, with those turning 62 in 2018 having a full retirement age of 66 and four months. That will go up gradually over the next several years, topping out at 67 for those who were born in 1960 or later.\\nWhat that means for those considering delayed retirement credits is that there will be fewer of them to claim. If your full retirement age is 67, then the largest number of credits you can get is 36 months, because that\\'s the length of time between full retirement age and reaching age 70. That makes the maximum boost to your benefits 24% instead of 32%, working out to a loss of $120 in potential delayed retirement credits on a monthly basis.\\nDespite not being able to get as many delayed retirement credits, those who have a while left before retiring still should think about the ideal time to claim their benefits and consider waiting if they can. Even as the reward for waiting goes down, the penalty for claiming early is also going up. The net impact still makes it smart to wait if you want your monthly check to be as big as it can be.\\nFiguring out when to take Social Security has personal aspects to it, but you\\'ll also want to consider the financial implications. Understanding the ins and outs of delayed retirement credits will help you make a smarter choice.\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.
