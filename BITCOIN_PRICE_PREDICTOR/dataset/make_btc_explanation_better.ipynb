      "Tax reform has had a major impact on the current earnings season, as just about every company stands to see changes to its tax situation as a result of new rules on foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates.Aflac(NYSE: AFL)is in an unusual situation, because even though most U.S. investors know the company as a provider of supplemental insurance products to workers throughout the country,Aflac gets most of its revenue from its Japanese business. That has dramatic implications for how new tax laws will affect the insurer in 2018 and beyond.\n",
      "Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, Aflac investors believed that the company's top line would take a big hit, but earnings were expected to be solid. The insurer got a nice boost from tax reform, and even when you take out that one-time impact, solid bottom-line performance on an adjusted basis set the stage for a good start in 2018. Let's look more closely at Aflac and how it did to finish 2017.\n",
      "Image source: Aflac.\n",
      "Aflac's fourth-quarter results were mixed, as most shareholders had expected. Revenue plunged 9% to $5.42 billion, but that was slightly less dramatic than the roughly 10% decline that most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income more than tripled to $2.4 billion. After adjusting for special items, adjusted operating earnings of $1.63 per share were $0.08 better than the consensus among investors.\n",
      "Tax reform was a huge part of the reason Aflac's bottom line rose so much. The company posted a $1.7 billion estimated benefit from tax reform, stemming in large part from expected lower tax rates on repatriated earnings from its Japanese unit. Aflac has been unusual in that it has typically brought back some capital from its overseas business even in the face of the higher tax rates that prevailed under previous law.\n",
      "The weaker yen again played a role in hurting Aflac's revenue. The yen fell about 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-earlier period, with the dollar rising from 109.10 yen to 112.98 yen over that span. Aflac blamed the yen for $0.03 per share in operating earnings, which was a smaller impact than theinsurer has seen in previous periods.\n",
      "Aflac's restructuring of its Japanese operations continued to weigh on performance as well. Local-currency premium income fell 3.3% in the quarter, with the insurer's anticipated pullback from first-sector savings products within Japan weighing on the company's ability to pick up new business in the more lucrative third-sector cancer, medical, and income support product category. New annualized premium sales were down 8% in local terms, and it took a rise in net investment income to offset some of the falling fundamental performance for the Japanese unit.\n",
      "In the U.S., Aflac managed to post a 2% rise in premium income and total revenue. Pretax operating earnings climbed almost 10%, as better margin reflected cost controls. Total new annualized premium sales climbed almost 7% in the segment during the quarter.\n",
      "CEO Daniel Amos kept his comments relatively simple. \"We are pleased with the company's overall performance for the year,\" Amos said, and he pointed to tax reform in giving Aflac \"an opportunity to accelerate and increase our investments in initiatives that reflect our company values and objectives.\" The CEO is also optimistic about its future, noting that challenges in Japan early in the year should give way to better performance in the second half, while the U.S. market should keep producing solid growth.\n",
      "In particular, Aflac intends to spend about $250 million on U.S. operations over the next three to five years. This should come in the form expanded employee benefits, training programs, and investment in technology and digital business initiatives. The insurer's guidance for 2018 was also favorable. Aflac expects earnings of between $7.45 and $7.75 per share, which compared favorably to the $7.50 per share consensus forecast among those following the stock.\n",
      "Aflac also took the unusual move of announcing another big boost to its quarterly dividend. The first-quarter payout of $0.53 per share will be 16% higher than its newly raised dividend just last quarter. Further stock repurchases of between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018 should also help to return capital to shareholders effectively.\n",
      "Aflac investors didn't seem surprised by the news, and the stock was close to unchanged in after-hours trading following the announcement. Some investors were likely waiting for more clarity on sometroubling allegations that the insurer has had to facein the past week. Yet from a fundamental business standpoint, with benefits from tax reform now in the books, Aflac has the opportunity to make the most of its trans-Pacific reach and tap into both of its target markets as effectively as it can.\n",

The Motley Fool recommends Aflac. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy . || TransCanada Corporation's(NYSE: TRP)stock rose around 8% in 2017, an advance that was relatively good when you compare it to North American midstream oil and natural gas bellwetherEnterprise Product Partners L.P.'s loss of around 2%. That said, business developments were the really memorable things last year. Here's a primer on the good and the bad news in 2017 that made the year so exciting for TransCanada Corporation and its shareholders.\n",
      "TransCanada Corporation is one of North America's largest midstream oil and natural gas companies, with pipelines assets crisscrossing Canada and spread throughout the United States. It even has a handful of natural gas pipelines in Mexico. Generally speaking, the $40 billion market cap company needs to build large projects to keep its businesses growing.\n",
      "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
      "The future got a little less certain in 2017 when TransCanada announced it had abandoned plans to build the Energy East and Eastern Mainline pipeline projects in its home country of Canada. The company took a roughly $1 billion Canadian charge. The bigger issue, though, is that these projects were worth roughly $16 billion Canadian and would have transported around 1.1 million barrels of oil a day.As The Motley Fool's Matthew DiLallo recently noted, the long-term growth picture for TransCanada is a lot less certain at this point in time.\n",
      "Luckily, though, all of the news from 2017 wasn't this bad. For example, the 2016 purchase of Columbia Pipeline Group helped TransCanada achievesolid earnings and cash-flow growth in the first halfof 2017. Although the third-quarter numbers were a little soft, that was the result of one-time charges and asset sales (Canadian solar assets were jettisoned, for example) that will help fund the company's near-term investment plans. Full-year results should be good reading, overall, all things considered.\n",
      "TransCanada's results were solid across the board through the first nine months of 2017. Image source: TransCanada Corporation.\n",
      "Operationally speaking, the midstream giant had some worthwhile successes. TransCanada brought a number of investments online in 2017, including the Northern Courier pipeline, the Rayne XPress pipeline, and and the Gibraltar pipeline. It also got the large Leach XPress project prepared to be successfully placed into service on January 1, 2018, setting this year up to be another good one on the top and bottom lines.The company is projecting as much as 10% earnings and dividend growth this year, by the way.\n",
      "That said, there was one more bit of good news: The company finally got approval from the U.S. government for the Keystone XL pipeline. There's still more work to be done before it gets built, but that was a major hurdle for TransCanada on a project that made the company headline news in the United States during the previous administration. In early 2018, TransCanada reported solid customer demand for the pipeline. Assuming things go smoothly from here, this project, which once appeared to be dead in the water, should help to soften the blow from the Energy East setback.\n",
      "TransCanada's project pipeline is still well stocked for the next few years. Image source: TransCanada Corporation.\n",
      "TransCanada had a good year on the project front in 2017. And, perhaps more importantly, it still has a sizable portfolio of projects to build over the next few years, as well. In fact, even as the company was reporting the cancellation of Energy East, it highlighted an impressive $24 billion Canadian investment pipeline that should support 8% to 10% earnings and dividend growth through 2020. This backlog, by the way, should give management plenty of time to find additional projects (and possibly acquisitions) to keep the company growing beyond that point.\n",
      "Although TransCanada's business results were solid in 2017, that's probably not what investors are going to remember about the year. The big news, which was a mix of good and bad things, was on the operations front, with the cancellation of Energy East and the U.S. government approval of Keystone XL being the most headline-worthy events. But even underneath those news grabbing stories there were some pretty positive things to remember, like a series of new pipelines either coming on line or getting very near it. At the end of the day, there was a lot of going on at TransCanada in 2017 to make it a memorable year for most investors.\n",

TransCanada had a good year on the project front in 2017. And, perhaps more importantly, it still has a sizable portfolio of projects to build over the next few years, as well. In fact, even as the company was reporting the cancellation of Energy East, it highlighted an impressive $24 billion Canadian investment pipeline that should support 8% to 10% earnings and dividend growth through 2020. This backlog, by the way, should give management plenty of time to find additional projects (and possibly acquisitions) to keep the company growing beyond that point. A lot of moving parts Although TransCanada's business results were solid in 2017, that's probably not what investors are going to remember about the year. The big news, which was a mix of good and bad things, was on the operations front, with the cancellation of Energy East and the U.S. government approval of Keystone XL being the most headline-worthy events. But even underneath those news grabbing stories there were some pretty positive things to remember, like a series of new pipelines either coming on line or getting very near it. At the end of the day, there was a lot of going on at TransCanada in 2017 to make it a memorable year for most investors.

      "Okay, thanks, Mike. What we'll do is start on page four of the deck, and I just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure 2017 was a remarkable year. It was remarkable for our country, for our industry where we operate and for AT&T. And it's been a long time since we've seen so many-what I would call-major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year, and we're calling these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It's going to be growth in US investment, in jobs, and in wages.\n",
      "And all of this began early in 2017 as regulations across all industries were being rationalized. In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light-touch regulation of the internet, and this was the approach that up until 2015 had allowed the internet to flourish and the US tech sector to lead the world in innovation. So, we, obviously, believe this was a step in the right direction, but this regulatory pendulum is gonna keep swinging back and forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all internet companies and to protect the consumer. We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the internet and on customer privacy. So, we're calling for an internet bill of rights, and you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses.\n",
      "But unquestionably the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment and job creation and wage growth. That lever was giving US companies a competitive tax system, one that levels the playing field with the rest of the world. We're very early in the process, but you've seen it. Company after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases, and employee bonuses. And we were first out of the gate. We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 frontline employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.\n",
      "So while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid, and this is gonna prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new level. What we're doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It's designed, and it's hardened for America's first responders. And then that will be our...\n",

Others, like Venezuela, have been forced to do so to battle out-of-control inflation that has crippled its economy. Opposed to a decentralized and anonymous system, the creation of a cryptocurrency that governments can control is their only option to wrestle back some semblance of ‘control’ that has been handed to the everyday man using cryptocurrencies.\\nSpeaking to RT at the WEF in Davos, Universa CEO Alexander Borodich said governments are keen to issue their own virtual currencies that would be backed by commodities like oil.\\n\\n“From my perspective, they will offer state country-wide cryptocurrencies like Cryptorruble or crypto-barrel if they like to… back the oil they have or other natural resources.”\\n\\nHe added that 2018 would see the emergence of these state-issued cryptocurrencies to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and other popular virtual currencies.\\nNefarious uses still a concern\\nDespite the best intentions of honest developers, exchanges and Blockchain engineers, there is a prevailing sentiment that the underworld still uses cryptocurrencies. It’s been a number of years since the closure of Silk Road and subsequent black markets, but heads of states are still citing concerns over the nefarious uses of virtual currencies.\\nAs quoted by the Independent, US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said there is a concerted effort being made to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for illicit trade.\\n\\n\"My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or Bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they\\'re not used for illicit activities.”\\n\\nA major concern is also the well-being of financial markets and systems that have been shaken up by the massive adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins in the past 12 months. In the words of Mnuchin:\\n\\n\"We encourage fintech and we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure all of our financial markets are safe. We want to make sure that the rest of the world -- and many of the (Group of) 20 countries are already starting on this -- have the same regulations.”\\n\\nIMF head Christine Lagarde also painted a harsh perception of cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n\"The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements.”\\n\\nNevertheless, the cryptocurrency community has been bullish on social media, slamming the apathy swirling around at Davos this week.\\n'], [15051, 'bitcoin-to-get-severely-forked-in-2018', 92106, 'Bitcoin to Get Severely Forked in 2018', '2018-02-01 18:00:00', 'Forking of Bitcoin’s original chain could become quite the trend in the coming year', 'The fear and build up towards Aug. 1, 2017, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash which forked off the original chain was monumental. However, it was a damp squib for the future of Bitcoin as it actually spiked in value.\\nSince then, forks on Bitcoin have become almost as common as ICOs, and in fact, forks on the Bitcoin chain look to be the latest trend for 2018 as new companies look to cash in on the familiar Bitcoin name.\\nAlready a forking mess\\nBitcoin Cash is, of course, the most well known Bitcoin fork out there, sitting comfortably in the top five coins in terms of market cap. However, in 2017, there were 19 registered Bitcoin forks. Still, that pales in comparison to the 50 that are expected this year, according to Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.\\nThat number could still rise further as there is even services out there that are providing rudimentary programming skills to launch a clone. This will of course have a big effect in the cryptocurrency market as hedge fund manager Ari Paul predicted in a tweet:\\n\\n9/ Both BTC and BCH will continue to hard fork and >10% of the value of each (if held today) will reside in new offshoots.\\r\\n— Ari Paul (@AriDavidPaul) January 14, 2018\\n\\nWhat the fork?\\nThere are a number of reasons to fork off the Bitcoin Blockchain, some do it, in the case of Bitcoin Cash, to seemingly improve facets of the old coin, while others may have different motives. As George Kimionis, chief executive officer of Coinomi puts it:\\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab. Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases rather than honest attempts to contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem.”\\nKimionis also sees a new phase in the ICO marketplace with the original hype simmered down somewhat. Forking adds a little edge to a new coin. And Rhett Creighton, who’s working on the upcoming Bitcoin Private fork, predicts:\\n\\n“Bitcoin forks are kind of the new altcoin. We are going to see now a bunch of Bitcoin forks. And they are going to start replacing some of the top hundred altcoins.”\\n\\nDanger to the vision\\nIt is hard to see these minor forks, even the likes of Bitcoin Gold and Diamond which reached the news, really, truly, adding much to the Blockchain environment. Even Bitcoin Cash has been linked to a money making scheme for the likes of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver. The difference between trying to improve the Blockchain, and to make money off a name, is a very blurred line.\\n\\n#CT_questions With as many as 50 #Bitcoin forks slated to take place in 2018, is it likely that some of them will begin displacing other #altcoins from the top-100 by market capitalization??\\r\\n— Cointelegraph — Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency News (@Cointelegraph) February 2, 2018\\n'], [15049, 'european-utility-giant-says-no-to-crypto-mining-even-with-clean-energy', 81806, 'European Utility Giant Says ‘No’ To Crypto Mining, Even With ‘Clean Energy’', '2018-02-01 16:35:00', 'Italy-based Enel, one of the largest power utility companies in Europe, has reported that it will not be selling renewable energy to off-grid mining company Envion, calling crypto mining an “unsustainable practice”', '\\nEnel, one of Europe’s largest power utility companies, announced today, Feb. 1, that they would not be selling renewable energy to crypto mining company Envion.\\nIn a brief statement to Reuters, the Italy-based company said that they had “no interest whatsoever in selling power” to a mining company:\\n\\n“Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonisation and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.”\\n\\nEnel had reportedly been in talks for a deal with the Swiss-based Envion AG, an off-grid mining company that claims to use decentralized, clean energy to power its mobile mining units, prior to today’s decision not to sell. Each Envion unit is installed inside of a shipping container and can be powered by a solar or wind farm anywhere in the world, eliminating a reliance on any one country’s infrastructure.\\nAlmost 70 percent of the world’s cryptocurrency mining takes place not in Europe, but in China, due to the cheap electrical costs there. However, as China has recently been tightening up regulations on crypto trading in the country, banning ICOs and exchanges, there is concern that miners could face power restrictions in China.\\nAs CT reported in December 2017, standard Bitcoin mining globally uses more power than most African countries. With crypto mining in China based on either the use of coal or hydroelectric power, companies have tried innovative ways to use more renewable forms of energy, like a Netherlands-based company that tried to harness human body heat for mining purposes.\\n'], [15042, 'fact-or-fud-pressure-drives-crypto-markets-down-almost-20', 104415, 'Fact Or ‘FUD’?

However, it soon proved many in the mainstream wrong as it’s popularity and price skyrocketed.\\nBoth of these factors have caused regulators and governmental institutions to sit up and take notice. But more than that, they have been forced to take action in response. Regulators are indeed catching up to Bitcoin, as more and more hard-nosed approaches begin to make the news. It now looks as if the taxation authorities of some countries are also starting to get to grips with this fast moving, and mostly anonymous, monetary system/growing asset.\\nJust like death and taxes\\nIt is hardly confusing as to why the tax man would want to come knocking on the Bitcoin community’s door. The power of this digital currency, along with others, has handed huge amounts of growth and prosperity to investors, prosperity that has up til now, been largely kept off the grid.\\nThe amount of money, growth, and returns on investment mean that there is room for governments to stake their claim, but their methods in doing so are far more difficult in the grey area of crypto earnings. In normal circumstances, banks and other centralised financial institutions are obliged to disclose finances to taxation authorities. However, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin. There is currently no obligation on exchanges to disclose user information. In fact, it is unconstitutional in most settings, as the USA’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found out when they requested data and were turned down by the courts.\\nAdditionally, Blockchain offers a transparent window into wallet addresses and transactions, but with anonymous IDs, these are no good to anyone trying to track down the owners of funds and their respective growth. This is also why there is a widely held fear of money laundering in the Bitcoin world.\\nHow do they do it — from US to Australia\\nGiven the difficulty in pegging down Bitcoin assets, different nations are trying different methods to try and claim tax from profits made by Bitcoin investors. The IRS, for example, has tried asking people nicely to declare their tax, and only 802 listened. The reset merely scoffed and remained in the shadows.\\nIn Australia, the government has deemed that cryptocurrencies are “a form of property”, and therefore: \"Any financial gains made from the selling of Bitcoin will generally be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) and must be reported to the Australian Tax Office,\" a spokesperson from the tax office said.\\nWhile this is still a grey area, there has been a warning issued. The Australian Tax Office has warned it will be looking out for tell-tale signs of crypto tax dodgers living beyond their means:\\n\\n\"The Australian Tax Office is here to help those that are genuinely trying to meet their tax obligations. However, where people attempt to deliberately avoid these obligations, we will take strong action.\"\\n\\nThis includes using \"a range of existing powers\" which are used to address \"unexplained wealth and conspicuous consumption that may arise through profits derived from cryptocurrency investment\".\\nThe South African Revenue Services (SARS) said in December last year that it would be exploring ways in which to track cryptocurrency trades in the hopes of addressing tax avoidance.\\xa0In the meantime, it is looking to provide its own guidance for citizens on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, its first foray into controlling the gains made. As Asheer Jaywant Ram, senior lecturer in the School of Accountancy at the University of the Witwatersrand, puts it:\\n\\n“I think there is enough interest and enough scope for SARS to be looking into this space, but now the question becomes, are they really going to accept taxpayers declaring their gains as capital gains tax or are they going to just say it is all revenue in nature?”\\n\\nIncome or capital?\\nThis is a key question that a lot of nations will have to put to the sword as, should it be taxed as income, as opposed to capital, it will be at a higher rate. Proving that it was indeed a long-term investment, and thus subject to gains tax, is far more difficult in the fast moving ecosystem that is Bitcoin. Ram adds:\\n\\n“Those sorts of debates on the nature of Bitcoin – I think those are coming – and I think it would be very interesting to actually see the outcome of those debates”\\n\\nIt is the very nature of cryptocurrencies that as they emerge more in the mainstream, they will be subjected to more scrutiny and regulations. While Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a disruptive force, scaring longstanding institutions such as banks, it is doubtful that they will be able to avoid tax forever. It would be more pertinent for a resolution to be met between tax authorities and crypto investors, lest there be bigger issues down the line.\\n']]\n",

The Committee on Banking and Other Financial Institutions received two weeks to “investigate the viability of bitcoin as a form of investment” and “come up with recommendations on how to control its uses and trade,” Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu explained. The lawmakers also asked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to launch a campaign against the risks of trading bitcoin. The Senate urged these institutions to issue clear statements in all the dialects spoken in Nigeria about the dangers of storing value with cryptocurrency. This came after last week when CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said that: “Cryptocurrency or bitcoin is like a gamble, and there is a need for everybody to be very careful.” Private Trading Groups are Hard to Probe Unfortunately for those that want to control the uses and trade of bitcoin in Nigeria, the market in the country is more decentralized than most places and thus resilient towards outside influence. This is because a large volume of trade goes on in private groups rather than in the open, according to reports from the region. While Nigerian P2P exchanges experienced record growth recently, the prevalence of scammers in the country pushed many traders into dozens of informal venues on Telegram, where trusted members are only trading among themselves. These groups reportedly vet the IDs and banking documentation of anyone that wishes to join themselves, and are therefore hard to infiltrate. Actual transfers are also made in person, and in secluded places like homes or the back of small shops. What could the Senate of Nigeria find out about bitcoin trading in the country?

The revenue from the company’s Graphics Division has reached almost a billion dollars in the last quarter of 2017. Recognizing the shortages, AMD is trying to satisfy both gamers and miners. Also read: Hydro-Quebec Unable to Meet Energy Demand From Cryptocurrency Miners More GPU Power Needed Increasing interest in cryptocurrency mining during the past year has compelled companies like AMD to address the rising demand for hardware components. Skyrocketing prices of bitcoin and the other cryptos have lured many new investors and ordinary enthusiasts into the mining business. GPUs are used to mine altcoins like Ethereum and Monero which require more moderate computing power. The miners’ appetite has forced Nvidia, AMD’s main competitor, to take steps to ensure gamers have a chance to get hold of its video processors. It recently asked retailors to limit the number of graphics cards that can be purchased at a time. AMD also admitted that its Radeon cards were in short supply and acknowledged that mining applications were responsible for the shortfall. Promising to increase production, the company hopes to satisfy the growing demand without disappointing any of its customers. “The graphics channel is very low, and we are certainly working to replenish that environment”, said CEO Dr. Lisa Su, quoted by Polygon. Because the availability of graphics cards is “lower than we would like it to be,” she added: We are ramping up production. Her announcement represents a sharp turn after last fall when Lisa Su predicted that the demand from cryptocurrency miners would start to level off in Q4. “As we look at it,[crypto-related demand] continues to be a factor, but we’ve seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that. So we’re being a little bit conservative on the cryptocurrency side of the equation,” she said in October. Speaking to investors during a conference call, Dr. Su presented the latest corporate earnings report, referring to the cryptocurrency mining market as a good part of AMD’s business. Advanced Micro Devices has announced $1.48 billion USD of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. $958 million of that total came from its Computing and Graphics division, where the year-on-year increase reached 60%. Sales of graphics cards, like the new Vega 56 and Vega 64, have been a key factor. Short on Memory Though Other important players may influence AMD’s ability to make good on its promises to satisfy gamers and miners. While ramping up production, the company must take into account the already recognized shortages of RAM. GDDR5 and HBM2 – the two main types of memory used in its RX 400, 500 and the new RX Vega graphics cards – are also undersupplied. In that respect, AMD’s management assured investors and customers it would work with its partners to overcome the deficit. Retailers also have a say when it comes to priorities on the GPU market. Some of them have already signaled their intention to implement their own measures to prevent cryptocurrency miners from buying the bulk of the available graphics cards. They simply want to make sure that gamers get their share of the stock. Another crucial factor is the fluctuating demand for mining equipment that tends to follow the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market. The profitability of mining operations is highly dependent on the rates of the mined coins, as their prices affect the rate of return of mining projects.

Also Read:&#xA0;U.S. Regulators Send Tether and Bitfinex Subpoenas Supply of USDT Increases Significantly Following December 6th Subpoena Earlier this week, it was reported&#xA0;that Bitfinex and Tether had been sent subpoenas by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 6th, 2017. Although further details pertaining to the subpoenas have not surfaced, the dramatic explosion in the number of USDT in circulation witnessed last year despite Bitfinex and Tether&#x2019;s loss of banking partners in March has long called into question the integrity and transparency of both companies. From February 2017, the number of USDT in circulation has grown by nearly 9,000%, rising from approximately $25 million USD at the start of February last year to more than $2.25 billion at the end of January 2018 according to Coinmarketcap. Since receiving the subpoena, Tether increased the number of USDT by 775 million, comprising a 52.5% increase in the total supply from December 6th, 2017. As such, approximately 34.5% of all USDT created were produced after Tether had received the subpoena from the CFTC. Suspicions Grow Surrounding Bitfinex and Tether&#x2019;s Operations Widespread speculation has attributed the ramping up of USDT issuance to a last ditch attempt by Tether and Bitfinex to manipulate the BTC markets in light of the subpoena. Many sources have argued that much of the Tether created since December 6th may have been produced without USD backing, and then traded on exchanges to drive the price to record highs before the subpoena&#x2019;s existence could be revealed. Accusations of insider trading have consistently hounded Bitfinex throughout its lifespan. In early 2013 an apparently disgruntled former Bitfinex employee leaked an email correspondence between himself and the former CEO of Bitfinex, Raphael Nicolle. In the email, the employee alleges that the trading account for Bitfinex&#x2019;s current Chief Financial Officer, Giancarlo Devasini, &#x201C;was credited one million dollars, money that he didn&#x2019;t have deposited in his account.&#x201D; The statement issued by Bitfinex and Tether regarding the CFTC subpoena claims &#x201C;We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations. It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.&#x201D; Expanding Mandate of the CFTC News of the subpoena broke just days after Jay Clayton, the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and J. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the CFTC, co-authored an open letter discussing their outlook on the role of the regulatory institutions with regard to the cryptocurrency markets. In the letter, it is asserted that following the launch of CBOE and CME&#x2019;s respective bitcoin futures markets, the CFTC &#x201C;gained oversight over the U.S. bitcoin futures market and access to data that can facilitate the detection and pursuit of bad actors in underlying spot markets.&#x201D; What is your opinion on the controversy surrounding the operations of Bitfinex and Tether?

Over 100,000 people had applied to be whitelisted, and the anticipation in the group&#x2019;s Telegram channel was palpable. The moment the public sale launched on Monday, everything fell to pieces as phishing emails successfully stole over $400,000 in ether and counting. To compound matters, The Bee Token team went into denial about the extent of the problem, exacerbating the community&#x2019;s losses and causing widespread anger. Also read:&#xA0;Neo ICOs Make a Shaky Start The Bee Token Loses Its Buzz Up until yesterday, decentralized Airbnb platform The Bee Token was a textbook case in how to run a crowdsale. It had developed an engaged and passionate community, had performed meticulous KYC and whitelist verification, and had fairly set a low cap and low contribution limits of 0.1 to 0.2 ETH to allow as many people as possible to take part. Even so, the team had to turn a vast number of people away. The 100,000+ who applied for the crowdsale is believed to be a record and The Bee Token&#x2019;s Telegram channel has well over 50,000 followers. As soon as the public sale started, all that hard work was undone in minutes. At some stage in the past month, hackers managed to get hold of The Bee Token&#x2019;s vast email list including names and contribution addresses. Phishing emails were sent out, purporting to be from The Bee Token, convincing hundreds of people to contribute to the wrong address. The damage could have been limited had The Bee Token been frank with their community. Instead they dispatched the meekest of emails, noting &#x201C;The Bee Token has received reports of fake emails, Telegram accounts, etc. claiming to represent the Bee Token ICO Crowdsale&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s a sentence which will go down as an understatement of the century. Hackers Help Themselves to the Honeypot Around the same time as The Bee Token&#x2019;s mildly worded cautionary email was dropping, their mailing list was receiving the following phishing email: The scam had been well orchestrated, with recipients even addressed by their first name. Experienced heads had no trouble in seeing through the fraud in an instant, with its glaring typo, talk of a Microsoft partnership, promise of the token doubling in price, and sudden increase in the contribution limit. Crypto in 2018 has more newbs than veterans though, and investors fell for the scam in their droves. The original phishing address plus a second one that was used have amassed over $400,000 in ETH and counting. Some people sent as much as 30 ETH. Rather than warn users in its Telegram channel about the phishing scam being perpetuated, The Bee Token had the audacity to play it down and to accuse channel members of spreading FUD. On its Twitter, there was also precious little to indicate that there was a huge scam underway and that hundreds of people had already been duped. In a bid to quell any negative PR, The Bee Token took a bad situation and made it significantly worse. In addition to the email scam, it&#x2019;s been claimed that The Bee Token website was hacked at some stage, with users being redirected from the .com to a .org, though with The Bee Token denying everything, this is hard to verify. To Bee or Not to Bee? It had been expected that The Bee Token&#x2019;s crowdsale would sell out rapidly, but uptake today has been sluggish, either due to investors being wary or simply due to having no ETH to spare after sending it to the wrong address on Monday. The team&#x2019;s failure to secure hundreds of thousands of customer records and to then deflect and deny doesn&#x2019;t bode well for the project&#x2019;s future. By the time the Telegram channel had been overrun with spam bots, late on Monday night, admins were reduced to blanket deleting all replies, a provision which remains in place today. The Bee Token&#x2019;s sorry crowdsale takes the total ETH stolen this week from ICO phishing scams to well over half a million dollars, as Experty also succumbed to the same fate. There was also the case of the vegetables on the blockchain ICO which exit scammed recently. The wild west days of cryptocurrency haven&#x2019;t ended: they&#x2019;ve simply switched from bitcoin to ethereum where the newbs and the profits lie.

The company sent out tax forms for 2017 to many clients who were not necessarily expecting it. Also Read: Bitcoin Tax Reporting Software Developer Node40 Acquired for $8m IRS Tax Form San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has issued 1099-K tax forms for a certain segment of its clients in the US on January 31. The company explains that it files 1099-K for customers who have received cash above the required reporting threshold, which is more than 200 receipt transactions or greater than $20,000 during the year. This also includes &#8220;business use&#8221; accounts, as well as GDAX accounts in which sales of cryptocurrency for cash have occurred that exceed the thresholds. Business use is meant to apply only to those who received payments in exchange for the provision of goods or services, not mining proceeds or transfers from other wallets they hold. Coinbase states that: “We used the best data available to us to determine whether your account activity qualifies as Business Use, including but not limited to factors such as completion of a merchant profile or enabling merchant tools.” This is similar to Etsy sellers and Uber drivers who also file 1099-K forms. What Can You Do? Over at the crypto community&#8217;s online forums and social media, complaints are already popping up from Coinbase clients upset about the move. Besides the obvious displeasure of learning that their transactions will be reported to the IRS, people are complaining about not being notified beforehand and above all about the figures being higher than what they expected. If you believe Coinbase made errors in your form, you should send them the information regarding the transactions that were counted in error via their support email. Consulting with a tax professional is advised as well. The fact that Coinbase would want to prevent more problems for itself with the IRS should not be surprising. Back in November a court ruled that the company had to report the personal data of 14,355 account holders who bought, sold, sent, or received more than $20,000 between 2013 and 2015.

Edward Kelso', 'Bitcoin futures regulators met for their first Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) of the new year, and it was dedicated exclusively to cryptocurrency futures. An advisory body to the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the not-quite two-year-old group held its only public meeting on the issue since bitcoin futures went live in December of last year. The all-day affair included commentary from regulators and futures market makers such as Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and all were asked about their impressions so far of bitcoin futures and the process of self-certification for exchanges. Also read: Nassim Nicholas Taleb vs David Birch on The Bitcoin Standard Market Risk Advisory Committee Holds First Public Meeting on Bitcoin Futures Since December 2017’s historic launching of two bitcoin futures markets on Cboe and CME, the verdict has been decidedly mixed depending upon the commenter. Bitcoiners hoped for a price run beyond 19,000 USD highs, but were soon to realize nothing close would be the case. The price in fact flattened and contract volume was slim. For professional traders and clearinghouses, the rush in December to take advantage of crypto fever seemed ill-conceived from the start, and soon contracts turned short as the price of bitcoin has essentially halved, leading to even more concern about volatility. Still other analysts believe the markets simply need to mature. Wednesday, 31 January 2018 held a first in Washington, DC: it’s both the date of the first meeting of MRAC and the first time CFTC has held a public meeting on bitcoin futures, bringing together market makers from Cboe, CME, and others. The effort is part of an ongoing conversation American regulators are beginning to have as cryptocurrency begins to increasingly dominate their discussions. At issue were the CFTC’s the statutory framework and regulatory process within the quirk of commodity exchanges’ self-certification; general discussion of the commission’s authority; oversight tools; product design and governance process of market makers for clearing new products and evaluating them post launch; and hearing from the market makers themselves about bitcoin futures’ roll out and the process thus far, including going forward. In a rather large closed circle gathering, attendees included Rostin Behnam, MRAC Sponsor and Commissioner, J. Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Julie Winkler, Chief Commercial Officer CME Group, Chris Concannon, President and Chief Operating Officer Cboe Futures Exchange, among many others. Informal Process Works Well “That informal process has worked well over the years,” CME’s Kathleen Cronin insisted, speaking to the issue of adding new rules or regulations on top of the existing structure. “To impose a formal process, I think, unnecessarily creates administrative burdens.” Indeed, in recent weeks Chairman Giancarlo suggested a process of “heightened review” for CFTC, and he and his staff reiterated as much throughout the meeting. A notable exception came from MRAC’s Rostin Behnam, who after acknowledging setbacks and exceptions, praised the status quo. “Self-certification is a unique process that has served market participants, the CFTC, and the general public very well,” Mr. Behnam began the morning’s session. “Indeed, since Congress authorized the CFTC to establish a self-certification process for the listing of new futures products in 2000, 15 exchanges have self-certified 10,628 new products, providing more risk management tools for commercial end-users across many different asset classes.” Both Mr. Concannon of Cboe and Ms. Winkler of CME were quick to point out the relative calm and frictionlessness of bitcoin futures markets, reminding regulators that neither market was rushed but was instead the work of many years in coordination with CFTC, brokers, clearinghouses, and the like. Both exchanges agreed self-certification allows them to be nimble in a globally competitive atmosphere, and places incentives where they need to be: at the exchange level. As if to pound home the point, CFTC’s Mr. Behnam thanked participants at the end of the meeting, pronouncing &#8220;self-certification works&#8221;.

      "When you take Social Security plays a vital role in how much you'll receive in benefits from the program. Most people understand that the earlier they take Social Security, the less they'll get. But the mechanics of how your full retirement age interacts with provisions that reduce early benefits, but increase monthly checks if you take them later, aren't entirely clear to everyone in or nearing retirement.\n",
      "If you want to get the biggest possible monthly benefits from Social Security, you have to take advantage of the program'sdelayed retirement credits. Yet under current law, younger people's ability to claim delayed retirement credits is being phased down, and future moves could limit credits even further.\n",
      "Image source: Getty Images.\n",
      "The Social Security Administration designed delayed retirement credits to augment benefits for those who chose to wait beyond full retirement age before claiming their Social Security. In order to figure out how big your delayed retirement credit will be, you'll need to follow this four-step process:\n",
      "• Figure out how much your primary insurance amount would be. That's the amount you would receive if you took your Social Security benefits right at your full retirement age.\n",
      "• Look up what your full retirement age is. That age is 66 for those who are turning 66 in 2018 or who have done so in recent years.\n",
      "• Decide how many months after your full retirement age you intend to start taking Social Security.\n",
      "• For each month that you wait after full retirement age, increase your primary insurance amount by two-thirds of a percent.\n",
      "An example can help you see how this works. Say that your full retirement age is 66 and your earnings history would produce a $1,500 primary insurance amount. If you take Social Security right at 66, you'll get $1,500 monthly. But say you want to wait until you turn 68. In that case, you'd take the number of months after your full retirement age, which is 24 months. Multiply 24 by two-thirds of a percent, and you'll get 16%.\n",
      "Doing the math, 16% of $1,500 is $240, so your delayed retirement credit will be $240, and you'll get a total of $1,740 per month -- valued in today's dollars and subject to future inflation -- if you wait two years before claiming your benefits. Wait until the maximum age of 70 -- beyond which no further delayed retirement credits are available -- and you'd get a 32% bump, to $1,980 per month.\n",
      "Delayed retirement credits are available only to worker benefits under Social Security. Spousal benefits don't qualify, so there's no reason for a spouse intending to receive only spousal benefits to wait beyond full retirement age before making a claim and getting those monthly payments started. However, if a spouse could claim either spousal benefitsorwork benefits on the spouse's own earnings history, then there could be reasons to hold off filing beyond full retirement age under current law.\n",
      "As you saw above, the largest number of delayed retirement credits for those who are reaching full retirement age now is 48 months, or a 32% increase to benefit amounts. That's because the age beyond which new delayed retirement credits are no longer available is set at 70, regardless of what the full retirement age is.\n",
      "Changes made to the Social Security program in the early 1980sraised the full retirement age. Early retirees are finding now that their full retirement age is higher than 66, with those turning 62 in 2018 having a full retirement age of 66 and four months. That will go up gradually over the next several years, topping out at 67 for those who were born in 1960 or later.\n",
      "What that means for those considering delayed retirement credits is that there will be fewer of them to claim. If your full retirement age is 67, then the largest number of credits you can get is 36 months, because that's the length of time between full retirement age and reaching age 70. That makes the maximum boost to your benefits 24% instead of 32%, working out to a loss of $120 in potential delayed retirement credits on a monthly basis.\n",
      "Despite not being able to get as many delayed retirement credits, those who have a while left before retiring still should think about the ideal time to claim their benefits and consider waiting if they can. Even as the reward for waiting goes down, the penalty for claiming early is also going up. The net impact still makes it smart to wait if you want your monthly check to be as big as it can be.\n",
      "Figuring out when to take Social Security has personal aspects to it, but you'll also want to consider the financial implications. Understanding the ins and outs of delayed retirement credits will help you make a smarter choice.\n",

At least one of them has disappeared. According to a CoinShares report Monday, Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment products suffered a $13 million outflow last week, reversing the trend of consecutive weeks of massive inflows as investors instead favored funds focusing on smaller cryptocurrencies such as ether ( ETH ) and Ripple’s XRP , crypto asset manager. Digital asset funds overall witnessed weekly outflows of $6.5 million after gaining $742 million of inflows through the previous four weeks. The trend turnabout came as BTC investors have seemingly run out of positive news to bid on after some major catalysts in recent weeks.

Story continues Mining Swinging Upward After a rough 2022, bitcoin mining is swinging upward, as CoinDesk analyst George Kaloudis writes. The bear market that sapped prices and publicly traded miners' stocks tumbling has lessened this year. Crypto mining is now mostly healthy. Bitcoin network’s hashrate, a measure of the amount of computing power committed to running the network, shows a bountiful capacity with which to run crypto’s premier network. As of July 21, Bitcoin’s hashrate was 400 exahash per second , up five-fold from June 2021. And a number of miners have returned to report healthy margins, especially those that have access to cheap energy like TeraWulf (WULF) and CipherMining (CIPHER), whose gross margins in Q1 2023 exceeded 60% (see below).

According to the analysis, investors should take time to understand the project before even considering an investment.Looking at the tokenomics of the Worldcoin token, launched on July 24, there are two absolute outliers. Firstly, the extremely high volume overtook the market cap, as the token reportedly traded 1.6 times its entire capitalization in the first 24 hours. How’s that even possible?According to Pechman, one must understand that the project has lent 100 million tokens to market makers. Only 8 million coins were handed out to users, who may or may not have flipped their positions, but this does not justify the $400 million reported volume.Now, on to the second part of the story, which Pechman finds even more concerning. Some 40% of the tokens will be unlocked between July 2024 and July 2025, and that’s 500x more than the 8 million currently awarded to users via airdrop.Ultimately, to maintain a market capitalization below Chainlink, for example, at $4 billion, the Worldcoin token price in July 2025 would have to be below $1, or 58% below the current level.That’s a huge risk for traders who are trying to capture 20% gains in the short term, given that there’s a huge amount of tokens from venture capitalists that paid much lower prices.Now, on to the show’s next topic: Pechman explores the Deribit Bitcoin volatility index, which reached its lowest level in two years. According to some analysts, that indicates a possible lack of price turbulence for Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future. But there’s a catch here, according to Pechman, as he does not believe the most likely outcome is lateral movement for Bitcoin.Want to know the rationale behind Pechman’s counterintuitive reading for the volatility indicator and how to position in this situation? Get those answers in the latest The Market Report, a show that runs exclusively on the new\\xa0Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\\n'], [113195, 'bitcoin-price-is-down-but-data-signals-that-30k-is-the-path-of-least-resistance', 8171, 'Bitcoin price is down, but data signals that $30K and above is the path of least resistance', '2023-07-25 21:39:55', 'Even with a price correction to $29,000, several Bitcoin price metrics show traders casting bets on a quick rebound. ', 'On July 24, Bitcoin\\xa0experienced a flash crash, plummeting to $29,000 in a movement now attributed to significant Bitcoin holders potentially liquidating their positions.\\xa0Amid the crash and market uncertainty, Bitcoin’s (BTC)\\xa0three major trading metrics continue to project a bullish outlook, signifying that professional traders have not reduced their leverage longs through the use of margin and derivatives.Analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in whales’ inflows to exchanges, reaching their highest level in over three years at 41% of the total BTC inflows. This forceful sell-off from whales alarmed investors, especially in the absence of any significant negative events impacting Bitcoin in the past month. Notably, a major concern stems from the ongoing court cases by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\\xa0against leading exchanges\\xa0Binance and Coinbase. Still, there hasn’t been any major advancement in those cases, which will likely take years to settle.Bitcoin’s price crash might have been related to the U.S. dollar reversionDespite historical volatility, Bitcoin’s crash became more pronounced following 33 consecutive days of trading within a tight 5.7% daily range. The movement is even more noteworthy given the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, crude oil rising by 2.4% and the MSCI China stock market index surging by 2.2%. However, it is essential to consider that the world’s largest global reserve asset, gold, experienced a dip of 0.5% on July 24. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reversed its two-month-long trend of devaluation against competing fiat currencies, climbing from 99.7 to 101.4 between July 18 and July 24.U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingViewThe DXY measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, including the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and others. If investors believe that the Federal Reserve will manage a soft landing successfully, it makes sense to reduce exposure to gold and Bitcoin while increasing positions in the stock market. Lower odds of a recession can positively impact corporate earnings.Margin and derivatives markets show resolute professional tradersTo understand whether Bitcoin’s price movement down to $29,000 has successfully ruptured the market structure, one should analyze margin and derivatives markets. Margin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency.OKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKXThe margin lending of OKX traders based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio rose between July 22 and July 24, suggesting that professional traders added leveraged long positions despite the recent price crash.Traders should corroborate this data with derivatives to ensure its marketwide impact. In healthy markets, BTC futures contracts typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium, known as contango, which is not exclusive to crypto.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: LaevitasNotice how the indicator sustained a healthy 5.7% average annualized premium, slightly lower than two days prior but still within the neutral range. This data confirms the resilience of margin markets, but to gauge market sentiment further, it’s also helpful to look at the\\xa0options markets.The 25% delta skew can reveal when arbitrage desks and market makers charge higher prices for protection against upside or downside movements. In short, a skew metric rising above 7% suggests traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin’s price, while periods of excitement generally yield a -7% skew.Bitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasThe 25% delta skew remained negative, indicating that bullish call options were trading at a premium compared to protective puts. This further supports the thesis that professional traders remain unfazed by the flash crash, with no evidence indicating pessimism among whales and market makers.The path to $30,000 and above shows the least resistanceIrrespective of the rationale behind the price move on July 24, Bitcoin bears could not dampen investor optimism, resulting in higher odds of a recovery above $30,000 in the short term. Notably, the mere appreciation of the U.S. dollar does not impact Bitcoin’s predictable monetary policy, censorship resistance and autonomous nature as a means of payment.On the brighter side, there are some positive triggers on the horizon, including the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund\\xa0and gaining regulatory clarity.

He clarified that while the group did not invite Western countries to its summit, the BRICS nations engage with the global community to address common issues.

Economist on Chinese Yuan and Reserve Currency The chief economist of South African financial services firm Nedbank, Nicky Weimar, discussed how a common BRICS currency could challenge the U.S. dollar’s hegemony last week, Independent Online reported. The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Noting that the economic bloc seeks to create a reserve currency on par with the U.S. dollar and reduce its dependency on the USD, Weimar emphasized that to achieve this goal: You need foreign exchange reserves and you need the trust of the investment community. The economist explained that the U.S. dollar became the global reserve currency due to the backing of the Federal Reserve, which the market trusted. “The U.S. has never defaulted on its debt. It’s given many people scary moments, but it’s never actually defaulted on its debt. The same cannot be said for any of the countries in the BRICS grouping. That’s the first problem,” Weimar described. Recently, the U.S. managed to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations amid a debt ceiling crisis. The second problem was that the only country in the BRICS economic bloc to carry such a reserve currency was China, Weimer described, adding: But China has capital controls. You cannot have a reserve currency if you have capital controls. So China in order to make this possible would have to undergo enormous financial liberalisation if they really want to compete with the dollar. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Furthermore, the economist stressed: “They also can’t do it and then change course. They would have to do it and stick with it to gain the trust of the investor. So this is miles away because, ultimately, you must gain the trust of the investor. A currency only has value if people believe it has value. And that trust has got to be there. So they’ve got a long journey ahead of them.&#8221; Noting that China has the ability to do this, but huge changes must be implemented, she opined: “I don’t actually see them talking along those lines. It’s almost like they haven’t made that connection yet that you need to let go of some of the control.

The new legislation, which legalizes and regulates the use of Bank of Russia’s digital currency for payments and other transactions, will enter into force on Aug. 1. President Putin Greenlights Law Introducing Digital Ruble as New Form of Russian Fiat Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a bill providing the legal basis for the implementation of Russia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Tass news agency and other Russian media reported. The new federal law introduces a third, digital form of the national currency, the ruble, after cash and non-cash (bank) money. Putin’s signature opens the door for using the CBDC named “digital ruble” as a means of payment and for other transfers in the Russian Federation. These will be free of charge for citizens while businesses will pay a 0.3% commission on the amount transferred. Transactions with the digital currency will be processed through a dedicated information system — the digital ruble platform. Under the law, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is the sole issuer of the CBDC and will be the only operator of its payment system. The CBDC will be stored in digital wallets and accessed through the mobile apps of commercial banks. At the same time, the law does not permit users to open bank accounts with digital rubles or receive loans in the central bank digital currency. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Ruble Remains the Only Legal Tender in Russia The legislation, which was passed earlier in July by both houses of Russian parliament, the State Duma and the Federation Council, introduces amendments to the country’s Civil Code. Its main provisions will enter into force on Aug. 1. The adoption of the law is viewed as part of Moscow’s efforts to not only offer an alternative for payments inside Russia but also find ways to circumvent financial restrictions imposed over its war in Ukraine. Last week, Governor Elvira Nabiullina revealed that the CBR is exploring options to integrate its platform with other CBDC systems to facilitate the use of the digital ruble in cross-border settlements. Russian officials have also been discussing the legalization of cryptocurrency payments, but only in foreign trade and under special legal regimes. Also this month, Putin signed a law effectively banning certain crypto payments for goods and services in Russia. This legislation requires exchanges for digital financial assets, or tokens issued on blockchains run by authorized operators, to reject transactions where these assets can be employed as “monetary surrogates.” At least for now, the ruble, in its different forms, remains the only legal tender in Russia which is yet to determine the legal status of decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

(Ripple). District Judge Analisa Torres&#x2019; highly anticipated order has been touted as a landmark victory by some digital asset lawyers and other professionals in the beleaguered industry. The SEC claimed Ripple and some of its senior leaders conducted unregistered offering and sale of &#x201C;crypto-asset securities&#x201D; in connection with its issuance of the XRP token (XRP). The following editorial was written by guest authors Wyatt Noble and Michael Handelsman for Kelman.Law Ripple vs. SEC Specifically, the SEC alleged in its complaint that Ripple sold more than 14.6 billion XRP, valued at more than $1.38 billion from 2013 through 2020, without filing a registration statement. According to the complaint these sales constituted a violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). Further, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an investment contract, which is a security under the SEC&#x2019;s jurisdiction according to the Securities Act (15 U.S.C &#xA7; 77b(a)(1)). The SEC alleged Ripple conducted three types of unregistered securities offerings: (1) programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges for which it received $757 million; (2) institutional sales under written contracts for which is received $728 million; and (3) other distributions under written contracts for which it recorded $609 million in &#x201C;consideration other than cash.&#x201D; How Judge Torres Ruled and Why In party holding for Ripple, the court considered whether XRP was an investment contract under the Howey Test, a legal doctrine that was developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co (328 U.S. 293 (1946)) to determine whether certain transactions are investment contracts. For the uninitiated, the Howey Test has three prongs: (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with the expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Cryptocurrency advocates and executives from centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken have argued for years that the Howey Test is incompatible with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. However, courts like the SDNY and regulatory agencies like the SEC appear to firmly believe the Howey Test is applicable to digital assets. Those who oppose applying the Howey Test tend to focus their arguments on the third prong, and argue that retail investors do not have a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others when buying from anonymous sellers through exchanges. Unsurprisingly, the third prong is where much of the controversy stemmed from in Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling. Judge Torres held under the Howey Test that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors on digital asset exchanges did not constitute the offer and sale of securities because those sales were blind bid/ask transactions and retail buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, another retail investor, or another seller of XRP. However, Judge Torres also held that Institutional sales of XRP did constitute the offer and sale of securities because institutional investors would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple&#x2019;s efforts, and Ripple led institutional investors to believe it would use the capital received from its institutional sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP ledger, in turn increasing the value of XRP. Additionally, other distributions were held not to constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because recipients of the other distributions did not pay money or &#x201C;some tangible and definable consideration&#x201D; to Ripple for their XRP. Many digital asset influencers, advocates, and even legal professionals have hailed the case as a decisive victory for both Ripple and the industry at large, claiming that Judge Torres essentially cemented that the XRP token itself is not a security and that her reasoning can and will be applied to other digital assets that have recently been subject to SEC scrutiny. However, the implications of this much-anticipated ruling are not yet certain and that may not change for several years. What Happens Next? The SEC will go back to the drawing board, and given that Chair, Gary Gensler, has already publicly expressed his disappointment with the ruling, an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals remains a possibility. Gensler&#x2019;s disappointment notwithstanding, an appeal could be risky for the SEC because the agency&#x2019;s jurisdiction over cryptocurrency markets could be reduced significantly if it appeals and loses. But part of this case &#x2013; that Ripple executives aided and abetted securities law violations in connection with institutional sales &#x2013; still has to go to trial, and SDNY has not yet set a date. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); What Should You Do in the Meantime?

Hong Kong, China, 25th July 2023, Chainwire. Crypto platform Open Exchange (OPNX) has partnered with UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Magomed Kurbaitaev&#x2019;s new sports metaverse, Gameplan. The dynamic partnership will give fans an all-in-one destination for events, gaming, shopping, and interactions with their sports idols. Through partnering with innovative projects such as Khabib&#x2019;s Gameplan, OPNX aims to facilitate the next wave of crypto adoption and innovation, allowing athlete and fan interaction to thrive through Gameplan. OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb said &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long-term goal of mine to work with Khabib. Crypto and MMA have many parallels. It takes extreme skill to navigate the chaos in both cases. As an athlete, I&#x2019;ve always admired Khabib&#x2019;s composure and how he treats his opponents with the deepest respect. As much as his fights are exciting to watch, every one delivers a powerful lesson to his opponents. &#x201C;I believe MMA fighters bring the exact energy crypto needs in a bear market. We need true fighters right now, or what I internally refer to as Ox energy. People who persist with an indomitable resolve no matter the conditions. It&#x2019;s an honor to be partnered with Gameplan to further fan engagement and the lives of athletes everywhere.&#x201D; Khabib expressed his optimism about the new partnership, stating: &#x201C;As an athlete with big experience, I understand sport and what it needs. I hope this partnership between OPNX and Gameplan will revolutionize the sports industry.&#x201D; Historically, the sports industry has presented limited avenues for fans to interact with athletes and a narrow range of opportunities for athletes to leverage their skills and fame outside of sport. Gameplan aims to solve these issues by building a deeper connection between high-profile athletes and their supporters. This includes the biggest names in football, boxing, and wrestling. Users can own a stake in their favorite sports teams and contribute to the platform&#x2019;s decision-making process through token-based voting. Leveraging Gameplan&#x2019;s native utility token, users can influence decisions related to team management, strategy, and much more. During gameplay, users can also engage with an AI-powered Khabib, a way for fans to learn more about the legendary MMA fighter while creating a personalized and memorable experience. Upcoming mini-games such as Buggy Race in the Desert and Fighting Game have also been recently announced. Gameplan&#x2019;s ultimate goal is to create an online space that solves existing issues in sport, while benefiting both sports fans and athletes alike, giving athletes a potentially additional stream of revenue and financial security for their talents and efforts. OPNX&#x2019;s trading platform is driven by a powerful portfolio margin architecture that allows traders to leverage their entire portfolio of assets including OX, the native crypto staking, governance and fee paying token. It features an innovative &#x201C;Stake To Trade For Free&#x201D; model, whereby users stake their OX to get up to 100% trading fee rebates in perpetuity. This model is democratic and dynamically adjusting, creating fundamental alignment between the exchange and traders. OPNX aims to facilitate the tokenization and trading of real-world assets that currently face opaque and inefficient markets, starting with the $20B crypto bankruptcy claims market. This has begun with the tokenization of Celsius and FTX claims. More recently, OPNX launched oUSD, its native credit currency. Soon, users will be able to use on-chain assets such as BTC, ETH, OX and more as collateral with off-chain order matching, allowing for provable solvency and liquidation, with on-chain security of user funds. Put together, this forms the foundation of an exchange with CeFi performance and DeFi security. Since launching two months ago, OPNX has been steadily growing and is now averaging over $50M/day volume.

A Look at Worldcoin’s Concentration of Holders at Launch The Worldcoin iris scanning crypto endeavor, striving to fortify universal basic income (UBI) and promote digital identification amid the era of artificial intelligence (AI), debuted its cryptocurrency on Monday, July 24. As for Tuesday&#8217;s data, at 10:15 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), a maximum supply of 10 billion WLD tokens exists, and currently, coingecko.com and coinmarketcap.com report a circulating supply of 107 to 108+ million WLD tokens. Upon its initial exchange listing, the price stood at $1.88 per token, later reaching a peak of $3.30 per coin that same day. As of July 25, 2023, WLD is being traded for prices ranging from $1.91 to $2.56 per coin, exhibiting extreme volatility. With current prices at $2.17 per unit, WLD has declined over 35% from its all-time high. The Worldcoin concept and initiative have been in existence since 2019 when they were established by Openai CEO Sam Altman, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania from the San Francisco and Berlin-based Tools for Humanity. Initially created on Ethereum, the token now utilizes the Optimism (OP) layer two blockchain. The project boasts support from numerous venture capital investors like Reid Hoffman, Andreessen Horowitz, Anatoly Yakovenko, Gavin Wood, Day One Ventures, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Coinfund, Blockchange Ventures, and more. Currently, with 107 million WLD tokens circulating, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s distribution is highly concentrated and held by only a few entities. For instance, among the 164,195 unique addresses possessing WLD tokens, the top wallet controls a significant 63.29% of the entire supply.

The third biggest WLD wallet possesses 8,722,407 coins, representing 4.9% of the circulating supply. Currently, the majority of WLD tokens are held by market makers and exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and the Optimism Gateway.

      "By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar nudged down on Monday, pulling back from six-month peaks against the yen as a U.S. debt ceiling deal lifted risk appetite in world markets and dented the greenback's safe-haven appeal. U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday finalised a budget agreement with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling until Jan. 1, 2025, and said the deal was ready to move to Congress for a vote. Having briefly touched a six-month high of 140.91 yen during Asia trade, the dollar drifted lower and was last down almost a third of a percent at 140.17 yen. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. unit's value against a basket of other major currencies, was also a touch softer around 104.23 but not far from last week's two-month peaks. The pull-back in the safe-haven dollar came as world stocks rallied on the positive news from Washington, although trade was generally subdued with parts of Europe, including Britain, on holiday along with the United States. \"An initial risk-on reaction is likely as the cloud of U.S. default has retreated,\" said Charu Chanana, a market strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. \"But focus will quickly turn to the fact that getting the deal is only a step in the process and an agreement from both the House and Senate by June 5 is still a big ask.\" The agreement would suspend the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, and cap spending in the 2024 and 2025 budgets. SPAIN ELECTION In Europe, the euro slipped 0.2% to $1.0709, showing little immediate reaction to news of a snap election in Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday polling would take place on July 23 after his left-wing coalition government suffered heavy losses in regional ballots on Sunday. Upbeat world sentiment pushed the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars off last week's six-month lows. The Aussie rose 0.35% to $0.6541, while the kiwi edged 0.2% higher to $0.6058. Story continues \"We've got a risk-positive response so far to the debt deal news,\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. \"Obviously there's still the need to get this debt deal over the line, but I think markets are happy to travel on the presumption that it will get done before the new X-date.\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday said the government would default if Congress did not increase the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling by June 5, having previously said a default could happen as early as June 1. Talk that the U.S. rate hiking cycle may not be over as soon as hoped given signs of economic strength have bolstered the dollar and could support the currency even as U.S. debt ceiling worries abate. The dollar was on course for a monthly gain of about 3% against the yen. The dollar index has gained 2.5% in May. Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in April and inflation picked up, adding to signs of a still-resilient economy. Money markets price in a roughly 62% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by 25 basis points in June, versus a roughly 26% chance a week ago. Elsewhere, the Turkish lira touched a record low at 20.10 per dollar after President Tayyip Erdogan secured victory in the country's presidential election on Sunday, extending his increasingly authoritarian rule into a third decade.

Polygon’s Matic led the losers, falling 2.84% to US$0.7081 and down 4.12% for the week. Dogecoin again headed the winners list on optimism it could become a feature in Twitter’s rebranding to X.com, which will include functions such as “payments/banking,” according to Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino on Monday. “Dogecoin rallied recently as speculation increased that the meme coin could be used as a payment mechanism for the rebranded Twitter platform,” said Markus Thielen, head of crypto research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport , in an emailed comment. “As crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer’s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat.” The total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.22% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume fell 27.41% to US$25.68 billion. Forkast 500 dips, Axie Infinity developer to make NFT game with CyberKongz The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam , a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella. The main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.60% in the past 24 hours to 2,642.91 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.60% for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes also logged losses, while the Cardano index edged higher. Total NFT trading volume dipped 2.90% in the past 24 hours to US$17.77 million, according to data from CryptoSlam .  Volumes on the Polygon Solana and Bitcoin networks rose, while Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano logged losses By NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour trading volumes, though total trades fell 39.79% to around US$695,000. “It’s another slow day in the NFT market, with a majority of NFT trades still being wash trades, or sellers accepting points farmers offer on Blur,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. The floor prices of leading Ethereum NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) have dropped 18% and 25% in the past 30 days, while trading volumes in the two collections over the same period slumped 80% and 67% respectively, according to NFT data tracker WGMI.io . “There’s nothing happening out there to make buyers want to buy NFTs at the prices they’re at still. Really, they’re massively overpriced even after declining over the year,” said Petscher. Yuga Labs, the developer of BAYC and MAYC, launched “Made by Apes” on Tuesday – a platform that grants BAYC and MAYC holders unique on-chain licences for their own products or services featuring the ape-themed NFTs. BAYC holders have already been building businesses around their collections, including fast food , clothing , and beverage operations, and more brands are using BAYC in promotions. “During this bear market we are seeing actual utility begin to get fleshed out like with Yuga Labs’ new fully on-chain IP licensing platform,” said Petscher. Elsewhere, Sky Mavis, the Vietnam-based developer behind play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity , announced a partnership with NFT project CyberKongz on Tuesday, where the two will jointly develop an NFT game based on CyberKongz’s incoming Genkai NFT collection. U.S. equity futures stall ahead of Fed move Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images U.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures inching lower, while S&P 500 futures edged up. All three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Tuesday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging gains for the 12th consecutive day, extending its longest winning streak in six years. In Asia, the main stock indexes fell on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement later today. China’s Shanghai Composite , Hong Kong’s Hang Seng , South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Nikkei all logged losses. Although a China Politburo meeting on Monday pledged policies to support the country’s ailing property market and revive domestic consumption, China’s stock market requires imminent and actionable measures from the government, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing a note by U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley. The U.S. Fed announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday with analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predicting a 98.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike this month. With a rise in rates mostly priced into markets, the focus of attention will be comments by Fed chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank views inflation trends, offering some pointers on future monetary policies. The current Fed under Powell has raised rates 10 times since March 2022 to tackle inflation that was running at 40-year highs last year. The annual inflation rate has since fallen to 3% in June from more than 9% last year. However, with inflation still above the Fed’s target of 2%, economists forecast more potential hikes this year based on recent comments by Powell. On the economic data front, the U.S. consumer confidence index hit a two-year high in July, according to the U.S. think tank Conference Board on Tuesday, “likely reflecting lower inflation and a tight labor market.” The consumer confidence index, together with data on inflation, the housing market and retail sales, contributed to the optimism that the U.S. economy could avoid a recession in 2023, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

      "As the race for the White House heats up, Democratic candidate for U.S. president Robert Kennedy Jr, has come out as a proponent of Bitcoin, and says he has proven that commitment by buying 14 Bitcoin last May. In a Wednesday Twitter Spaces interview with crypto investor and podcaster Scott Melker, Kennedy called Bitcoin the currency of freedom, and said he decided to become a crypto investor after he was chided by media outlets for promoting Bitcoin but didn’t own any. “I bought two Bitcoin for each of my seven children,” Kennedy said, noting he made the move \"right after\" his appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in May. “Now I’m a Bitcoin owner, and I’m sure they’ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn’t put my money where my mouth is.” Kennedy and Melker also discussed how banks can shut down customer bank accounts without warning, and suggested political pressure may be behind the closure of the bank account of Joseph Mercola, described by the New York Times as \"the most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation online.\" Chase bank has shut down our business bank accounts along with the accounts of my CEO and CFO, as well as their family members (including spouse and child). They've refused to provide any reason for doing so, the oldest account has been active for 18 years.… — Dr. Joseph Mercola (@mercola) July 25, 2023 \"Here we have a powerful banking interest that that has received all kinds of federal government support and it's utterly dependent on its on its relationship with the Fed and the federal government and it is shutting down one of its customers for political speech,\" Kennedy said. \"I think that incident alone should be one that all of us should be terrified about, and and it makes the the move toward Bitcoin, all the more important.\" Story continues Crypto Booster Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Bought Bitcoin Despite Recent Claim: Report During the annual conference held in Miami, Florida, Kennedy said covid-19 restriction led him to Bitcoin, and he claimed to be the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin donations through the Lightning Network. But he also said that he didn't own any, and wasn't there to give investment advice. Currently, the price of a Bitcoin is $29,330 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of his speech at Bitcoin 2023, the price of a Bitcoin stood around $27,128. If Kennedy’s claims are true, the Kennedy Bitcoin treasury would be worth around $400,000 today. Earlier this month, a financial disclosure document obtained by CNBC showed Kennedy’s Family held (at the time) between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin. His conference address established his strong alignment with so-called digital gold. “When I witnessed this cataclysm—this devastating use of government repression—I realized for the first time how free money is as important to freedom as free expression,” Kennedy said. Kennedy added that the many environmental claims about Bitcoin are unfounded. “I believe that the environmental arguments against Bitcoin are a smokescreen to obscure the real motives for suppressing Bitcoin,” he said, citing the massive cost of endless wars and environmentally destructive projects. While Kennedy is not expected to win the Democratic party's nomination—online wagering sites put his odds at around 11 percent —he has drawn the support of fervent crypto fans. “I’m very happy for the support I’ve gotten from the Bitcoin community,” Kennedy said. || As the race for the White House heats up, Democratic candidate for U.S. president Robert Kennedy Jr, has come out as a proponent of Bitcoin, and says he has proven that commitment by buying 14 Bitcoin last May.\n",

      "“I bought two Bitcoin for each of my seven children,” Kennedy said, noting he made the move \"right after\" his appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in May. “Now I’m a Bitcoin owner, and I’m sure they’ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn’t put my money where my mouth is.”\n",
      "Kennedy and Melker also discussed how banks can shut down customer bank accounts without warning, and suggested political pressure may be behind the closure of the bank account of Joseph Mercola, described by theNew York Timesas \"the most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation online.\"\n",
      "\"Here we have a powerful banking interest that that has received all kinds of federal government support and it's utterly dependent on its on its relationship with the Fed and the federal government and it is shutting down one of its customers for political speech,\" Kennedy said. \"I think that incident alone should be one that all of us should be terrified about, and and it makes the the move toward Bitcoin, all the more important.\"\n",

The bank left the door open for another increase in September. Ether moved higher with most top 10 cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners as its trading volume more than doubled in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin led the losers as the meme token lost some steam after gaining over 11% for the week. The Forkast 500 NFT index traded flat and U.S. equity futures were mixed, reflecting the same performance on Wall Street on Wednesday. Top cryptos gain Bitcoin rose 0.90% in the last 24 hours to US$29,459 as of 07:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 1.37% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached US$29,600 early Thursday morning. Ether moved up 0.88% to US$1,874, but remained 0.68% lower for the seven-day period. The marginal gains followed the Fed’s decision to raise benchmark lending rates in the U.S. to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest in 22 years, to slow inflation. In a press conference , Fed Chair Jerome Powell said another rate hike in September is possible, but said decisions will be determined by the data at the time. “An interesting time for crypto markets although you wouldn’t be able to tell when looking at the price action. With macro markets timidly risk-on, BTC and ETH rose slightly to recoup levels lost earlier this week,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock . With the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher in the past 24 hours. Solana’s SOL led the winners, jumping 9.51% to US$25.35, but still sitting on a 3.80% loss for the full week. The token’s 24-hour trading volume surged more than 100% to over US$682 million, surpassing that of Ether and indicating investors are betting on a strong rebound. “SOL’s price increased by about 49% in the past month, primarily driven by the stable development and progress of Solana’s blockchain and ecosystem, with steady growth in user base and restoration of reputation,” said Greta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX . Dogecoin lost ground after being the darling of the week as the rebranding of Twitter raised speculation it could be part of a payments system on the social media network. It fell 3.52% to US$0.0784, though is still holding a weekly gain of 11.82%. The total crypto market capitalization gained 0.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion, while trading volume rose 20.51% to US$30.91 billion. Story continues Elsewhere, Worldcoin , a cryptocurrency and digital identity project founded by OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman, issued its controversial WLD token on Monday and prices soared. The token dipped 1.49% to US$2.28 on Thursday, but is up 36.30% since the launch. “OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project might just be one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency projects in recent years,” Louis Schoeman, managing director at Dubai-based trading information platform Forex Suggest , said in emailed comments. “ The project’s core offering, its World ID, requires users to prove via an iris scan that they are human, and not an AI bot. Those who sign up will receive Worldcoin’s cryptocurrency token WLD,” said Schoeman. “This sort of digital ID will be necessary in the development of AI, in order to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fiction from reality, which is a particular concern in the financial and democratic systems. Worldcoin wants to defend people from AI misinformation and make it clear who and what to trust online,” added Schoeman. In emailed comments on Worldcoin, Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at the U.S.-based crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital , said: “The value of a real non-transferable, and cryptographically secure identity is potent as it could reduce digital fraud, help bank the unbanked, and even reduce the number of times I have to convince robots I’m not a robot a day.” According to reports, the Worldcoin project signed up more than two million users during beta testing and is now expanding operations to 35 cities across 20 countries, but the US isn’t yet one of them, said Schoeman. “Altman made it clear the company didn’t feel the US would make or break the project, but with North America said to account for around 18% of the total world crypto value received, breaking into the US market will be a major concern for Worldcoin,” he said. “A global digital ID enabling private identity verifications is undeniably revolutionary, however, it’s certain to stir up controversy, with many already calling the exchange of biometric data for crypto tokens an outlandish bribe,” said Schoeman. Forkast 500 flat, Sotheby’s NFT auction sells out The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam , a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella. The main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up a slight 0.57% in the past 24 hours to 2,651.39 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. It’s still down 2.22% for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses. While the overall NFT market remains in the doldrums, auction house Sotheby’s NFT art collections are attracting buyers of so-called generative art, or the process of algorithmically generating art forms. Themes and Variations , an NFT collection of 500 generative artworks by artist Vera Molnár, was sold out within an hour in a Dutch auction on Wednesday for 631 ETH (US$1.2 million). It is the first collection in Sotheby’s Gen Art Program, which aims to spotlight three generative artists each year. With secondary markets included, the trading volume of  Themes and Variations has totaled over US$2 million, according to data from CryptoSlam , making it the top NFT collection by that measure in the past 24 hours. “In the future we’re going to look back at this time in NFTs as a very special time for generative art,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. “Art is still the best use case for NFTs, and it’s exciting to see so many collectors appreciating it even in a market like this,” he said. “I’m expecting to see a rather steady stream of higher-end generative art from Sotheby’s, whose new generative art platform is using the Art Blocks Engine to produce these on-chain works,” added Petscher. Total NFT trading volume dropped 5.16% in the past 24 hours to US$18.41 million, according to data from CryptoSlam .  Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains fell, while Solana, Mythos Chain and Immutable X saw an increase in trading. “Mythos Chain and ImmutableX are also up 47% and 69%, showing yet again that gaming NFTs (from Gods Unchained, CS:GO, TF2, DOTA 2) are another perfect use case for NFTs,” said Petscher. Elsewhere, social media platform Reddit launched the latest series of its NFT collectible avatars on early Thursday. Entitled “Retro Reimagined”, the collection features designs from both independent artists and NFT developers like Cool Cats . Unlike ordinary NFTs, Reddit’s collectible avatars are purchased with fiat currencies through a Reddit platform at fixed prices, but can be transferred to a third-party crypto wallet as NFTs. U.S. equity futures rise Image: Getty Images U.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Thursday in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading the prior day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Wednesday to extend its longest winning streak in six years, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logged losses. As analysts expected, the Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday in its more than year-long quest to reduce the inflation rate. The benchmark rate is now in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001. In Asia, the main stock indexes rose after the Fed’s rate rise was in line with expectations. China’s Shanghai Composite , Hong Kong’s Hang Seng , South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Nikkei all logged gains. In a press conference following the Fed announcement, the chair Jerome Powell said his agency will keep focused on economic data for future discussions on rate adjustments, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The Fed typically has eight monthly meetings a year to decide on interest rates, with the next two-day gathering scheduled for September 19-20. “We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks,” said Powell in his statement. He said the Fed remains committed to bringing the annual inflation rate to its long-term goal of 2%. The annual inflation rate in June sat at 3.0% . On the U.S. economic data front, investors have Thursday’s report on gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter, and Friday’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index for additional insights into the state of the economy and inflation. Amazon, MasterCard and McDonald’s are also set to release their second-quarter earnings on Thursday. (Updates with comment on Solana in first section.)

This, in turn, offers a key argument for future price rises, per CryptoQuant contributor SimonaD.“Since the end of March, we can see in the chart that the trading volume has registered a decrease and SSR a stagnation, while we have an increase in the circulating supply of the stablecoin Tether (the largest stablecoin in terms of volume), followed by an increase of Bitcoin’s price,” she wrote in one of the platform’s Quicktake market updates on July 26. “A possible interpretation would be that big investors have stocked up on stablecoins and are waiting for better prices.

He stressed that the U.S. currency is being destroyed, emphasizing that it is losing purchasing power. “Rather than fighting inflation, the Fed fueled the fire,” Schiff claimed. Peter Schiff Warns U.S. Dollar Is Being Destroyed Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff issued multiple warnings on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve&#8217;s announcement of a 25 basis point interest rate hike. Responding to Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s statement that the Fed is no longer forecasting a recession for the U.S. economy, Schiff said on Fox Business Wednesday: The Fed is wrong on its recession outlook. We&#8217;re going to have a recession. In fact, it&#8217;s going to be a severe one &#8230; Inflation is going to get worse, not better. &#8220;The real rate of inflation, regardless of how the government wants to misreport it &#8230; is higher than five percent,&#8221; the economist insisted. Commenting on Powell&#8217;s statement regarding rate cuts, Schiff tweeted: &#8220;Powell just admitted that the Fed will start cutting rates long before inflation gets down to 2%. That&#8217;s a big admission that&#8217;s bullish for gold and bearish for the dollar and Treasuries.&#8221; The gold bug also pointed out that after the rate hike announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average “finished higher for the 13th day in a row, its longest winning streak since 1987.” He detailed: “We all know how that year turned out. Investors ignored rising interest rates, a falling dollar, and rising budget and trade deficits until suddenly all that bad news mattered.” In a follow-up tweet on Thursday, Schiff opined: “Despite yesterday&#8217;s Fed rate hike, financial conditions in the U.S. have eased. The dollar and bond yields are down and stocks are up. Easier conditions have already pushed oil prices near $80, with more upside to come.

You want to own real money, which would be gold, [and] you want dividend-paying stocks that are not in dollars — that are outside the United States.” He emphasized: You&#8217;ve got to get out of the dollar because that&#8217;s what being destroyed.

In April, he made a similar recommendation, warning that the USD&#8217;s reserve currency status is in jeopardy. Earlier this month, the gold bug said the Federal Reserve has already lost the inflation fight but the markets have not figured that out yet. He also warned that all banks will fail.

In an exclusive interview with South Africa&#8217;s foreign minister Naledi Pandor, the diplomat underscored that BRICS harbors no intentions of &#8220;weaponizing the oceans,&#8221; clarifying that talks of peace will be held during the 15th BRICS Summit. Pandor also noted that a platform aimed at resolving the conflict between Ukraine and Russia would be established. “We’re not standing against anyone; we’re not standing for anybody. We work for the good of the world. We’re not seeking to weaponize the oceans, we’re not seeking to weaponize the forest, and we’re not seeking to weaponize climate change,” stated Pandor to RT. She further added that other African leaders intended to strengthen their ties with Russia. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); While it has been reported that the upcoming summit will focus less attention on creating a BRICS reserve currency, expansion of membership appears likely. Ambassador Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s envoy to BRICS, hinted that the group would grow this year. Pandor substantiated these claims in an interview with RT, revealing that three new members will be joining the BRICS bloc, bringing the total to eight participating nations. Though she did not disclose the identities of the new member countries, Pandor praised the expansion as &#8220;fantastic&#8221; news.

Prosecutors Seek Sam Bankman-Fried’s Detention Over Witness-Tampering Allegations During a hearing on Wednesday, prosecutors in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), founder and former chief executive of the failed digital asset exchange FTX, asked U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan to send the crypto entrepreneur to jail. SBF has been living under house arrest in his parents’ home in Palo Alto, California since December 2022 when he was released on a $250 million bond. His trial on criminal charges linked to the collapse of the crypto trading platform is scheduled to begin in October. The prosecution is seeking modifications to Bankman-Fried’s bail agreement following the publication of an article in the New York Times about Caroline Ellison, former CEO of the Alameda Research hedge fund, also founded by Bankman-Fried, NPR and CNN reported. In an interview with the newspaper, SBF showed some of the “private writings” of Ellison, who is also his former girlfriend. This, according to the prosecutors, amounted to witness tampering.

As traditional asset markets in Asia opened Friday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $29,240, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours and roughly where it's stood since a Monday dip triggered by the latest Binance mishap and bad economic news from China. With a couple of blips under, BTC has been changing hands in a $29,000 to $31,800 range since mid-June – immune from rate hikes, inflationary fears and other macro angst. Brent Xu, the CEO and co-founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, told CoinDesk in an email that the status quo is likely to continue. “Bitcoin barely budged following the Federal Reserve’s most recent rate hike, underscoring that this period of heightened rates has pretty much been priced in,\" Xu wrote. \"This is certainly indicative of BTC resilience and indeed resilience for the broader digital asset market. But I’m not expecting a meaningful breakout to the upside any time soon.\" Story continues Ether has been similarly inert and was recently trading at $1,862, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptos were largely in negative territory, albeit not by much with SOL and MATIC, the tokens of smart contract platforms Solana and Polygon, off 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Stellar Lumina's XLM token continued its recent upswing, rising 2.9% from Thursday, same time. Umee's Xu does not expect a return to \"bull market conditions\" until 2024's BTC halving. \"That’s also when we’ll probably start seeing rate cuts happening,\" he wrote. \"Cuts could come sooner, I should caveat, if there’s some sort of breakage that takes place, such as a credit crunch or an acceleration of the banking crisis.” Biggest Gainers Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +13.7% Entertainment XRP XRP +8.1% Currency Avalanche AVAX +3.7% Smart Contract Platform Biggest Losers Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Stellar XLM −16.8% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE −11.5% Currency Chainlink LINK −10.8% Computing Insights/News Some Bitcoin Whales Are Waiting for Price Moves The bitcoin supply held by addresses with a balance of between 10 and 100 BTC has taken a slight downward turn, indicating that these larger holders of bitcoin are content to wait at the moment. Data provided by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode underscores that investors are equal parts reluctant to add or relinquish bitcoin, but also that they do not see BTC as undervalued. Addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 bitcoin are exhibiting similar behavior. Oddly, the amount of bitcoin held by addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 has risen slightly, although for bitcoin’s largest holders with more than 100,000 BTC, the supply balance has remained stable.

Brave Browser Now Lets Users Sell Crypto Within the Wallet Opera GX Fake My History Once enabled, the Fake My History feature, available on OperaGX compatible systems, acts as a deadman switch and will auto-delete the browsing history and replace it with a fake but nice version. Users can test the feature by checking the box next to Pretend Im already dead.\" Opera GX Pretend I'm Dead Once the user confirms they want to hide their history, OperaGX will generate random history links to replace the originals. Opera GX Fake History With Fake My History, were wiping the slate clean and replacing your scandalous digital shenanigans with a totally fake version of your browsing past, OperaGX Product Director Maciej Kocemba said in a statement . \"In case your nosy partner, parent or roommate opens Opera GX and sneaks a posthumous peek at your history, they can marvel at your bogus yet impeccable online tastes and the charmingly fictional exploits that fill your digital past,\" the statement promises. \"Bask in the glory of a phony yet plausibly sanitized browsing history that rivals the innocent escapades of the internets most virtuous users.\" Tech companies are becoming increasingly attuned to both the privacy and social media preferences of the recently departed. Both Apple and Facebook provide a \"Legacy Contact\" feature to designate a trusted person to handle your accounts after you die or are incapacitated. Story continues Crypto companies are following suit. Last year, web3 startup Sarcophagus raised $5.47 million towards the development of a crypto deadman switch that, if the user did not provide proof of livelihood, the content of the Sarcophagus, such as cryptocurrency, messages, and private keys, would automatically be sent to the address of their designated recipient. Opera says the Fake My History feature will also work in less extreme cases, such as the user deciding to use a different internet browser. Opera did not specify how the fake links are chosen. Crypto Wallet Prototype Discovered Inside Microsoft Edge Browser Launched in 2019, OperaGX is an internet browser geared toward gamers and fans of anime. Embedded controls in OperaGX allow users to control the amount of RAM and processing power the browser uses, as well as a variety of gamer-focused features like built-in Twitch subscriptions, Discord messaging, and gaming news. Last year, Opera also leapt headlong into the blockchain space by adding support for decentralized applications like Metamask and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, and Polygon through its Opera Crypto Browser . In March, Opera introduced artificial intelligence to its Opera and Opera GX browsers. The  AI Prompts  feature added access to ChatGPT and ChatSonic directly into the Opera sidebar. Those with ChatGPT Plus subscriptions can use the more powerful GPT-4 and ChatGPT plugins.

Standard Chartered head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick said while speaking with CNBC that he expects Bitcoin to end 2024 in the range of $100,000 to $120,000. He believes that Bitcoin is likely to witness price patterns seen during previous halving cycles.Even as Bitcoin consolidates, could select altcoins break out of their slumber? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin’s bounce off the 50-day simple moving average ($29,250) is fizzling out near the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,743), indicating that higher levels are attracting sellers.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day EMA has started to turn down, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the negative territory, indicating that bears have a slight edge. If bears sink the price below the immediate support at $28,861, the BTC/USDT pair may start a downward move to $27,500 and then to $26,000. Such a move will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the $24,800-to-$31,000 zone for some time.The important level to watch on the upside is the 20-day EMA. If this resistance is scaled, the pair may rise toward $31,000. The bears are likely to face an acid test in the $31,000-to-$32,400 region.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) has been stuck between the moving averages for the past few days. This shows that the bulls are buying the dips to the 50-day SMA ($1,854), but they haven’t been able to kick the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,881).ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThis narrow-range trading is unlikely to continue for long and it may soon resolve with a strong breakout. If the bulls shove the price above the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair may rise to $1,930 and, eventually, to $2,000.Conversely, if the price turns down and plunges below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand. The pair may then oscillate inside the large range between $1,626 and $2,000 for a while longer.XRP price analysisAfter the sharp rally on July 13, XRP (XRP) may enter a period of consolidation. The boundaries of this range could be $0.67 and $0.85.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.68) is sloping up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have a slight edge. The XRP/USDT pair could rise to $0.75 and if this level is surmounted, the rally could continue to $0.85.On the contrary, if the price turns down and plunges below $0.67, it will suggest that bears have seized control. The pair could then nosedive to the breakout level of $0.56. This level is likely to attract buyers.BNB price analysisBNB’s (BNB) price action has been random and volatile inside the triangle as both the bulls and the bears battle it out for supremacy.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf buyers push the price above the moving averages, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the resistance line of the triangle. This is an important level for the bears to defend because a break above it could propel the price to $265 and then to the pattern target of $290.Instead, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears are maintaining their selling pressure. The pair could then drop to the support line. This level may attract buyers, but if they fail to achieve a meaningful bounce, the pair may decline further and retest the vital support at $220.Cardano price analysisCardano (ADA) rebounded off the breakout level of $0.30 on July 26, indicating that the bulls are trying to defend the support with vigor.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($0.30) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage to either the bulls or the bears. If bulls sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $0.34. This level may act as a strong barrier, but if crossed, the ADA/USDT pair could reach $0.38.If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly pull the price below the uptrend line. If they manage to do that, the pair may skid to $0.27 and then to $0.26.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) bounced off the support at $22.30 on July 25 and climbed above the 20-day EMA ($24.07) on July 26, indicating that the range-bound action remains intact.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will try to push the SOL/USDT pair to the overhead resistance at $27.12. A break and close above this obstacle may indicate the start of a new uptrend. On the other contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA could pull the price to the important support at $22.30. This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, the pair could slump to the 50-day SMA ($20.22).Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin (DOGE) rose above the overhead resistance of $0.80 on July 25, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum.

The DOGE/USDT pair could slide to the 20-day EMA ($0.07), which is an important level to watch for in the near term.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the likelihood of a break above $0.08. If that happens, the pair may soar toward $0.10. This positive view will be negated if the price continues lower and tumbles below $0.07.Polygon price analysisPolygon (MATIC) has been trading between the moving averages for the past three days, suggesting a state of indecision between the bulls and the bears.MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price cracks below the 50-day SMA ($0.69), it will suggest that the bears are back in the driver’s seat.

That could start a recovery to $0.80 and, subsequently, to $0.90.Litecoin price analysisLitecoin (LTC) is attempting a recovery, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($92). This suggests that the bears are active at higher levels.LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and drops below $87, it will indicate the resumption of the down move. The LTC/USDT pair could then fall to $81, where the bulls may try to arrest the decline.Alternatively, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the selling pressure could be reducing. There is a minor resistance at $96, but if bulls overcome it, the pair may rally toward $106.Polkadot price analysisThe bulls repeatedly failed to propel Polkadot (DOT) above the 20-day EMA ($5.24) in the past three days, indicating that the bears are selling on minor rallies.DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears will try to strengthen their position further by pulling the price below the 50-day SMA ($5.05). If they manage to do that, the DOT/USDT pair could dump to the next support at $4.74 and then to $4.65.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rises and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between the 50-day SMA and $5.64 for a few more days.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

A total of 69 leaders, including all African heads of state, have already been invited to the August summit where de-dollarization will be among the key topics discussed. Russian Official on BRICS Currency Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk stated in an interview with Russian news outlet Tass on the sidelines of the second Russia-Africa summit this week that the issue of creating a basket of BRICS currencies may be raised at the economic bloc’s upcoming summit that will take place from Aug. 22-24. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The Russian official was quoted as saying: The BRICS leaders will hold a meeting soon where they may touch upon the settlement system issue. Perhaps, the idea of creating a basket of currencies based on a certain payment unit will also be discussed. &#8220;Perhaps the leaders will decide to task the relevant expert bodies with looking into the matter,&#8221; Overchuk added, emphasizing: &#8220;Clearly, it’s a very difficult issue.&#8221; While the Russian deputy prime minister believes that the topic of a common BRICS currency could be discussed at the summit, South Africa’s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, has stated: &#8220;There’s never been talk of a BRICS currency, it’s not on the agenda.&#8221; South Africa is hosting the BRICS summit this year, and Sooklal is in charge of planning the agenda for the summit. Moreover, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, recently clarified that the economic bloc has no immediate plan to launch a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar. Noting the distinction between de-dollarization efforts and the creation of a common BRICS currency, he stressed: “The development of anything alternative is indeed a medium to long-term ambition.” Both Maasdorp and Sooklal have stressed that the BRICS bloc is focusing on de-dollarization and encouraging the use of national currencies for trade settlements. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Furthermore, rumors abound that the BRICS group might unveil a gold-backed currency during the summit. Many people believe that a unified BRICS currency could erode the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status as the world&#8217;s dominant currency. Nevertheless, obstacles lie ahead. Russia&#8217;s central bank governor, for instance, has cautioned that a BRICS currency will require the consent of numerous parties, and she foresees potential challenges in its implementation. The BRICS has drawn interest from over 40 countries seeking to join the group. According to Sooklal, 22 nations have already formally applied. Moreover, the diplomat has revealed that South Africa has invited 69 leaders to the summit, including all of the African heads of state and the leaders of major Global South bodies.

India and Brazil Push Back Against China’s Attempt to Expand BRICS, Officials Say Officials familiar with the discussions on the future composition of the BRICS bloc of developing economies have revealed that India and Brazil are pushing back against a Chinese bid to rapidly expand the group, which currently also includes Russia and South Africa. According to a report by Bloomberg, New Delhi and Brasília have raised their objections in preparatory talks for the organization’s upcoming summit in Johannesburg. During the forum on Aug. 22 &#8211; 24, the five nations will discuss the induction of new members.

Brazil hopes to avoid enlargement partly because of such worries while India seeks strict rules for the association of other countries without formally expanding BRICS. Both want to discuss granting observer status to candidates at the summit, the quoted officials added. The hosting nation, South Africa, supports considering different membership options but doesn’t necessarily oppose expansion, two of the officials noted. “The BRICS leaders meeting last year authorized the expansion of membership, adding more members to BRICS is the political consensus of the five BRICS countries,” China’s foreign ministry pointed out in a statement. Decisions in Johannesburg Will Require Consensus Among Members Russia does not hold a firm position on expanding BRICS, according to Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy which advises the Kremlin’s administration. Commenting on the matter, he elaborated: It’s broadly in favor of BRICS expansion, but without any huge enthusiasm. It’s following the others’ lead. We won’t block any decision. And any decision at the August summit will require consensus among the current member states who meet at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as a geopolitical clash with Russia with unprecedented Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, the office of South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa announced that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, will not attend the meeting in person as a result of an indictment and an arrest warrant issued for him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the Ukraine war. The report also revealed that following India’s opposition to China’s push for expansion, rules for admission were drafted and these will be discussed at the leaders’ summit next month, according to two Indian officials. While trying avoid confrontation in BRICS, Brazil is working to resist Chinese pressure to make it an antagonistic body that challenges the G7, a Brazilian official said.

This prominent aphorism: &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t believe me or don&#x2019;t get it, I don&#x2019;t have time to try to convince you, sorry,&#x201D; was Nakamoto&#x2019;s curt response to questions surrounding the potential solutions for Bitcoin&#x2019;s transaction speeds and double spending issues. The 13th Year Anniversary of Nakamoto&#x2019;s Iconic Quote In the summer of 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto was a palpable presence in the nascent world of digital currency, busily shaping Bitcoin&#x2019;s path and engaging in lively dialogues online. Within a span of two weeks &#x2013; from July 2 to July 17, 2010 &#x2013; Nakamoto found the time to articulate 73 thoughtful responses on specific discussions hosted on the forum bitcointalk.org. It was in this buzzing hub, on July 29, 2010, that Nakamoto memorably posted his now-famous line, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t believe me or don&#x2019;t get it, I don&#x2019;t have time to try to convince you, sorry,&#x201D; in a thread aptly titled: &#x201C;Scalability and transaction rate.&#x201D; Nakamoto&#x2019;s comment was in response to the statement from another crypto proponent who said: &#x201C;10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good. It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.&#x201D; Nakamoto replied by saying: See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less. If you don&#x2019;t believe me or don&#x2019;t get it, I don&#x2019;t have time to try to convince you, sorry. The Snack Machine Thread Bitcoin&#x2019;s creator left a link to the &#x201C;snack machine thread,&#x201D; which discusses the problem of how to enable fast transactions for small purchases like from a vending machine using BTC. The issue is that BTC transactions take some time to confirm on the blockchain, so someone could double-spend before the transaction is confirmed and get a product from a vending machine without actually paying for it. The participants discussed ideas like debit accounts, escrow services, and prepaid accounts to enable fast transactions without waiting for blockchain confirmations. Screenshot of Satoshi Nakamoto&#x2019;s &#x201C;rough back-of-the-envelope example.&#x201D; The core problem is that the Bitcoin network takes about ten minutes on average to confirm transactions, but vendors need transactions to process instantly to deliver products right away. But if transactions aren&#x2019;t confirmed, people could double-spend BTC to cheat the system or vendor. In the bitcointalk.org thread, an escrow service is suggested to enable instant transfers between accounts while still doing blockchain confirmations, but this adds costs through a third party. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Nakamoto suggests a solution where a payment processor listens for double-spend attempts and alerts if it detects any before a transaction propagates across the whole network. This would prevent most double-spend attacks. Nakamoto then provides a simple example of how fast a transaction can spread throughout the network. The &#x201C;Scalability and transaction rate thread&#x201D; and the &#x201C;snack machine thread&#x201D; are two bitcointalk.org posts that provide a unique glimpse into Satoshi&#x2019;s approach to problem-solving. In this example, if one transaction has even a small head start, it will spread throughout the network faster than the other one (the double-spend). It illustrates the exponential growth of transaction propagation &#x2013; an early lead can result in an overwhelming advantage due to the geometric (exponential) nature of network propagation. &#x201C;So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage,&#x201D; Nakamoto wrote at the time. &#x201C;The payment processor has connections with many nodes. When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends. If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.&#x201D; Bitcoin&#x2019;s inventor added: A double-spent transaction wouldn&#x2019;t get very far without one of the listeners hearing it. The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor&#x2019;s broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes. The &#x201C;snack machine thread&#x201D; has played a recurring role in a multitude of discussions over time. After Nakamoto&#x2019;s initial response and a subsequent, seemingly rushed reply in a separate post, his comment was notably brief. Perhaps the architect of Bitcoin felt a robust certainty in the solution previously provided in the &#x201C;snack machine thread&#x201D; or, quite possibly, Nakamoto was inundated with other commitments that day, leading to a more clipped response. The exact motivations remain shrouded in mystery, but the remark about lacking the time to explain has since been conjoined with the broader narrative of Bitcoin. It&#x2019;s celebrated as a poignant aphorism, encapsulating the inherent challenge in truly grasping the intricate mechanics of Bitcoin. How do you interpret Satoshi&#x2019;s wisdom today?

Besides questioning the legitimacy of its data acquisition processes, CNIL is also delving into how this biometric data is stored. Notably, Worldcoin has collected this data for over two million registrants who have participated in its project. French Regulator CNIL Questions Worldcoin&#8217;s Biometric Data Storage Worldcoin debuted last Monday, and based on available data and footage of individuals enrolling, the venture has been amassing momentum and recognition. In an email conversation with Reuters, CNIL disclosed to the media outlet that it was scrutinizing Worldcoin&#8217;s data gathering and has initiated inquiries. &#8220;The legality of this collection seems questionable, as do the conditions for storing biometric data,” CNIL informed the news platform. Ahead of launching its worldcoin (WLD) token, Worldcoin asserted it had already enlisted more than 2 million users. As of now, over 300,000 WLD token holders exist, and on July 29, 2023, WLD documented upwards of 1 million transactions. Moreover, the CEO of Openai and co-founder of Worldcoin, Sam Altman, presented a video revealing Worldcoin registrants queuing up to undergo iris scans and shared that an individual was being scanned &#8220;every 8 seconds.” Even prior to Worldcoin&#8217;s introduction, the project encountered backlash, and an article published by MIT Technology Review detailed accusations of deceit and exploitation. In October 2021, former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden criticized the iris scanning initiative telling Altman they should abstain from cataloging people&#8217;s eyeballs. In correspondence with Reuters, the French regulator disclosed its commencement of investigations into Worldcoin. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); CNIL also highlighted that Bavarian authorities are collaborating with the regulator in examining Worldcoin’s data collection practices. The Worldcoin Foundation responded to Reuters&#8217; request for comment concerning the investigation. The foundation noted that it falls under the jurisdiction of the European Union and Bavarian authorities such as the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision. “[Worldcoin] is designed to protect individual privacy and has built a robust privacy program,” the Worldcoin Foundation stated in its email. Additionally, the group emphasized that the project adheres to all laws and regulations within every jurisdiction where Worldcoin operates. &#8220;The project will continue to cooperate with governing bodies on requests for more information about its privacy and data protection practices,&#8221; the Worldcoin Foundation added.

Notably, a year-long assessment reflects an even more significant contraction, with over 86,000 WBTC evaporating from circulation since last July. A 12-Month Decline of 86,000 WBTC in Circulation The Wrapped Bitcoin project has been around for over four years, originating as WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain at the dawn of 2019. As of now, WBTC stands as the 16th most valuable asset among a sea of alternative cryptocurrencies, boasting a market value of approximately $4.73 billion. Despite its ranking as the most prominent wrapped bitcoin (BTC) derivative token, a notable contraction in circulating coins has been observed since the previous year. To illustrate, rewind to July 13, 2022, when the circulating supply of WBTC stood at an estimated 247,832 WBTC. Today, that number has tapered off to 161,460 WBTC. This translates into a reduction of over 86,000 WBTC, or a significant 34% pullback in circulating supply over the past year. Additionally, a comparison of WBTC&#x2019;s market valuation reveals substantial growth &#x2013; ascending from a tad above $3 billion on January 2, 2023, to a markedly more impressive figure of $4.73 billion today. While the WBTC supply is down more than 22,000 tokens since January 2, 2023, the wrapped bitcoin token supply has increased by 11,010 WBTC since March 2023. In March, WBTC&#x2019;s supply hit a low of 150,450 WBTC. However, this augmentation in value primarily stems from the appreciating price of BTC, which was exchanging hands at $16,662 per unit on January 2. Now, each BTC coin commands a price of $29,328, marking a surge of over 65% since the year&#x2019;s commencement. Given that WBTC&#x2019;s prices are tethered to BTC on a 1:1 basis, WBTC&#x2019;s market capitalization followed suit, even though its circulating supply contracted by 22,088 WBTC in the same period. Thus, of the total 34% reduction since last year, 12.03% of the cutback unfolded in 2023. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Specifically within the Ethereum network, WBTC boasts a total of 74,191 holders. However, the lion&#x2019;s share of the supply&#x2014;51.5% to be exact&#x2014;resides under the control of the top ten addresses. These ERC20-based WBTC tokens are spread across a multitude of decentralized finance (defi) platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Arbitrum. In fact, the top 100 Ethereum-based addresses command 75.16% of the total WBTC supply. Beyond Ethereum, WBTC also finds utility on other blockchains including Arbitrum, Cronos, Fantom, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche.

      "Current Florida Governor and GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis continued his campaign against central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ), vowing a ban if he were elected president. “Done, dead, not happening in this country,” said DeSantis at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa last Friday. “If I am the president, on day one, we will nix central bank digital currency.” DeSantis has been an outspoken critic of CDBDs for allowing “government-sanctioned surveillance,” and in March signed a bill to prohibit the use of a national CBDC as money within Florida. As for the broader subject of crypto, he’s been far more supportive, previously calling its use a question of civil liberty and describing bitcoin ( BTC ) as a “threat to the current regime.” Central bank digital currencies, which are a tokenized form of a country’s fiat currency issued by the government, are becoming a growing wedge between political sides in the U.S., with the GOP, broadly speaking, not in favor, and the Democrats so far mostly silent on the subject.

Instructions will be given at that time. If you should require assistance during the call, please press * then 0. Also, as a reminder, today\\'s teleconference is being recorded.\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Viola, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\nMichael J. Viola--Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. As Tony said, I\\'m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&Ts Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T\\'s Chief Financial Officer. Randall is going to provide an overall business update and cover our 2018 business initiatives, and John\\'s gonna cover results along with the 2018 outlook. And then we\\'ll follow with our normal Q&A.\\nAs always, our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website.

It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\\'re gonna be subject to risks, uncertainties, and results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.\\nAnd so now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to AT&T\\'s Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson.\\nRandall Stephenson--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay, thanks, Mike. What we\\'ll do is start on page four of the deck, and I just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure 2017 was a remarkable year. It was remarkable for our country, for our industry where we operate and for AT&T. And it\\'s been a long time since we\\'ve seen so many-what I would call-major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year, and we\\'re calling these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It\\'s going to be growth in US investment, in jobs, and in wages.\\nAnd all of this began early in 2017 as regulations across all industries were being rationalized. In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light-touch regulation of the internet, and this was the approach that up until 2015 had allowed the internet to flourish and the US tech sector to lead the world in innovation. So, we, obviously, believe this was a step in the right direction, but this regulatory pendulum is gonna keep swinging back and forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all internet companies and to protect the consumer. We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the internet and on customer privacy. So, we\\'re calling for an internet bill of rights, and you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses.\\nBut unquestionably the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment and job creation and wage growth. That lever was giving US companies a competitive tax system, one that levels the playing field with the rest of the world. We\\'re very early in the process, but you\\'ve seen it. Company after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases, and employee bonuses. And we were first out of the gate. We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 frontline employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.\\nSo while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid, and this is gonna prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new level. What we\\'re doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It\\'s designed, and it\\'s hardened for America\\'s first responders.

Others, like Venezuela, have been forced to do so to battle out-of-control inflation that has crippled its economy. Opposed to a decentralized and anonymous system, the creation of a cryptocurrency that governments can control is their only option to wrestle back some semblance of ‘control’ that has been handed to the everyday man using cryptocurrencies.\\\\nSpeaking to RT at the WEF in Davos, Universa CEO Alexander Borodich said governments are keen to issue their own virtual currencies that would be backed by commodities like oil.\\\\n\\\\n“From my perspective, they will offer state country-wide cryptocurrencies like Cryptorruble or crypto-barrel if they like to… back the oil they have or other natural resources.”\\\\n\\\\nHe added that 2018 would see the emergence of these state-issued cryptocurrencies to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and other popular virtual currencies.\\\\nNefarious uses still a concern\\\\nDespite the best intentions of honest developers, exchanges and Blockchain engineers, there is a prevailing sentiment that the underworld still uses cryptocurrencies. It’s been a number of years since the closure of Silk Road and subsequent black markets, but heads of states are still citing concerns over the nefarious uses of virtual currencies.\\\\nAs quoted by the Independent, US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said there is a concerted effort being made to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for illicit trade.\\\\n\\\\n\"My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or Bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they\\\\\\'re not used for illicit activities.”\\\\n\\\\nA major concern is also the well-being of financial markets and systems that have been shaken up by the massive adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins in the past 12 months. In the words of Mnuchin:\\\\n\\\\n\"We encourage fintech and we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure all of our financial markets are safe. We want to make sure that the rest of the world -- and many of the (Group of) 20 countries are already starting on this -- have the same regulations.”\\\\n\\\\nIMF head Christine Lagarde also painted a harsh perception of cryptocurrencies.\\\\n\\\\n\"The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements.”\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, the cryptocurrency community has been bullish on social media, slamming the apathy swirling around at Davos this week.\\\\n\\'], [15051, \\'bitcoin-to-get-severely-forked-in-2018\\', 92106, \\'Bitcoin to Get Severely Forked in 2018\\', \\'2018-02-01 18:00:00\\', \\'Forking of Bitcoin’s original chain could become quite the trend in the coming year\\', \\'The fear and build up towards Aug. 1, 2017, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash which forked off the original chain was monumental. However, it was a damp squib for the future of Bitcoin as it actually spiked in value.\\\\nSince then, forks on Bitcoin have become almost as common as ICOs, and in fact, forks on the Bitcoin chain look to be the latest trend for 2018 as new companies look to cash in on the familiar Bitcoin name.\\\\nAlready a forking mess\\\\nBitcoin Cash is, of course, the most well known Bitcoin fork out there, sitting comfortably in the top five coins in terms of market cap. However, in 2017, there were 19 registered Bitcoin forks. Still, that pales in comparison to the 50 that are expected this year, according to Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.\\\\nThat number could still rise further as there is even services out there that are providing rudimentary programming skills to launch a clone. This will of course have a big effect in the cryptocurrency market as hedge fund manager Ari Paul predicted in a tweet:\\\\n\\\\n9/ Both BTC and BCH will continue to hard fork and >10% of the value of each (if held today) will reside in new offshoots.\\\\r\\\\n— Ari Paul (@AriDavidPaul) January 14, 2018\\\\n\\\\nWhat the fork?\\\\nThere are a number of reasons to fork off the Bitcoin Blockchain, some do it, in the case of Bitcoin Cash, to seemingly improve facets of the old coin, while others may have different motives. As George Kimionis, chief executive officer of Coinomi puts it:\\\\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab. Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases rather than honest attempts to contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem.”\\\\nKimionis also sees a new phase in the ICO marketplace with the original hype simmered down somewhat. Forking adds a little edge to a new coin. And Rhett Creighton, who’s working on the upcoming Bitcoin Private fork, predicts:\\\\n\\\\n“Bitcoin forks are kind of the new altcoin. We are going to see now a bunch of Bitcoin forks. And they are going to start replacing some of the top hundred altcoins.”\\\\n\\\\nDanger to the vision\\\\nIt is hard to see these minor forks, even the likes of Bitcoin Gold and Diamond which reached the news, really, truly, adding much to the Blockchain environment. Even Bitcoin Cash has been linked to a money making scheme for the likes of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver. The difference between trying to improve the Blockchain, and to make money off a name, is a very blurred line.\\\\n\\\\n#CT_questions With as many as 50 #Bitcoin forks slated to take place in 2018, is it likely that some of them will begin displacing other #altcoins from the top-100 by market capitalization??\\\\r\\\\n— Cointelegraph — Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency News (@Cointelegraph) February 2, 2018\\\\n\\'], [15049, \\'european-utility-giant-says-no-to-crypto-mining-even-with-clean-energy\\', 81806, \\'European Utility Giant Says ‘No’ To Crypto Mining, Even With ‘Clean Energy’\\', \\'2018-02-01 16:35:00\\', \\'Italy-based Enel, one of the largest power utility companies in Europe, has reported that it will not be selling renewable energy to off-grid mining company Envion, calling crypto mining an “unsustainable practice”\\', \\'\\\\nEnel, one of Europe’s largest power utility companies, announced today, Feb. 1, that they would not be selling renewable energy to crypto mining company Envion.\\\\nIn a brief statement to Reuters, the Italy-based company said that they had “no interest whatsoever in selling power” to a mining company:\\\\n\\\\n“Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonisation and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.”\\\\n\\\\nEnel had reportedly been in talks for a deal with the Swiss-based Envion AG, an off-grid mining company that claims to use decentralized, clean energy to power its mobile mining units, prior to today’s decision not to sell. Each Envion unit is installed inside of a shipping container and can be powered by a solar or wind farm anywhere in the world, eliminating a reliance on any one country’s infrastructure.\\\\nAlmost 70 percent of the world’s cryptocurrency mining takes place not in Europe, but in China, due to the cheap electrical costs there. However, as China has recently been tightening up regulations on crypto trading in the country, banning ICOs and exchanges, there is concern that miners could face power restrictions in China.\\\\nAs CT reported in December 2017, standard Bitcoin mining globally uses more power than most African countries. With crypto mining in China based on either the use of coal or hydroelectric power, companies have tried innovative ways to use more renewable forms of energy, like a Netherlands-based company that tried to harness human body heat for mining purposes.\\\\n\\'], [15042, \\'fact-or-fud-pressure-drives-crypto-markets-down-almost-20\\', 104415, \\'Fact Or ‘FUD’?

But more than that, they have been forced to take action in response. Regulators are indeed catching up to Bitcoin, as more and more hard-nosed approaches begin to make the news. It now looks as if the taxation authorities of some countries are also starting to get to grips with this fast moving, and mostly anonymous, monetary system/growing asset.\\\\nJust like death and taxes\\\\nIt is hardly confusing as to why the tax man would want to come knocking on the Bitcoin community’s door. The power of this digital currency, along with others, has handed huge amounts of growth and prosperity to investors, prosperity that has up til now, been largely kept off the grid.\\\\nThe amount of money, growth, and returns on investment mean that there is room for governments to stake their claim, but their methods in doing so are far more difficult in the grey area of crypto earnings. In normal circumstances, banks and other centralised financial institutions are obliged to disclose finances to taxation authorities. However, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin. There is currently no obligation on exchanges to disclose user information. In fact, it is unconstitutional in most settings, as the USA’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found out when they requested data and were turned down by the courts.\\\\nAdditionally, Blockchain offers a transparent window into wallet addresses and transactions, but with anonymous IDs, these are no good to anyone trying to track down the owners of funds and their respective growth. This is also why there is a widely held fear of money laundering in the Bitcoin world.\\\\nHow do they do it — from US to Australia\\\\nGiven the difficulty in pegging down Bitcoin assets, different nations are trying different methods to try and claim tax from profits made by Bitcoin investors. The IRS, for example, has tried asking people nicely to declare their tax, and only 802 listened. The reset merely scoffed and remained in the shadows.\\\\nIn Australia, the government has deemed that cryptocurrencies are “a form of property”, and therefore: \"Any financial gains made from the selling of Bitcoin will generally be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) and must be reported to the Australian Tax Office,\" a spokesperson from the tax office said.\\\\nWhile this is still a grey area, there has been a warning issued. The Australian Tax Office has warned it will be looking out for tell-tale signs of crypto tax dodgers living beyond their means:\\\\n\\\\n\"The Australian Tax Office is here to help those that are genuinely trying to meet their tax obligations. However, where people attempt to deliberately avoid these obligations, we will take strong action.\"\\\\n\\\\nThis includes using \"a range of existing powers\" which are used to address \"unexplained wealth and conspicuous consumption that may arise through profits derived from cryptocurrency investment\".\\\\nThe South African Revenue Services (SARS) said in December last year that it would be exploring ways in which to track cryptocurrency trades in the hopes of addressing tax avoidance.\\\\xa0In the meantime, it is looking to provide its own guidance for citizens on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, its first foray into controlling the gains made. As Asheer Jaywant Ram, senior lecturer in the School of Accountancy at the University of the Witwatersrand, puts it:\\\\n\\\\n“I think there is enough interest and enough scope for SARS to be looking into this space, but now the question becomes, are they really going to accept taxpayers declaring their gains as capital gains tax or are they going to just say it is all revenue in nature?”\\\\n\\\\nIncome or capital?\\\\nThis is a key question that a lot of nations will have to put to the sword as, should it be taxed as income, as opposed to capital, it will be at a higher rate. Proving that it was indeed a long-term investment, and thus subject to gains tax, is far more difficult in the fast moving ecosystem that is Bitcoin. Ram adds:\\\\n\\\\n“Those sorts of debates on the nature of Bitcoin – I think those are coming – and I think it would be very interesting to actually see the outcome of those debates”\\\\n\\\\nIt is the very nature of cryptocurrencies that as they emerge more in the mainstream, they will be subjected to more scrutiny and regulations. While Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a disruptive force, scaring longstanding institutions such as banks, it is doubtful that they will be able to avoid tax forever. It would be more pertinent for a resolution to be met between tax authorities and crypto investors, lest there be bigger issues down the line.\\\\n\\']]\\n- Bitcoin News: [[106827, \\'2018-02-01 23:55:06\\', \\'Senate of Nigeria Launches Probe of Bitcoin Trading in the Country\\', \\'senate-of-nigeria-launches-probe-of-bitcoin-trading-in-the-country\\', \\'Avi Mizrahi\\', \\'Nigeria is known to have one of the biggest and fastest growing bitcoin markets in the whole of Africa. The authorities in the country have apparently caught wind of this and now want to examine the phenomena and decide what they can try and do about it. Also Read: Bitcoin Tax Reporting Software Developer Node40 Acquired for $8m Nigerian Lawmakers Want to Know How to Control Bitcoin The Senate of Nigeria, the upper house of the Nigerian legislature, has ordered an investigation into bitcoin trading in the country. The Committee on Banking and Other Financial Institutions received two weeks to “investigate the viability of bitcoin as a form of investment” and “come up with recommendations on how to control its uses and trade,” Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu explained. The lawmakers also asked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to launch a campaign against the risks of trading bitcoin. The Senate urged these institutions to issue clear statements in all the dialects spoken in Nigeria about the dangers of storing value with cryptocurrency. This came after last week when CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said that: “Cryptocurrency or bitcoin is like a gamble, and there is a need for everybody to be very careful.” Private Trading Groups are Hard to Probe Unfortunately for those that want to control the uses and trade of bitcoin in Nigeria, the market in the country is more decentralized than most places and thus resilient towards outside influence. This is because a large volume of trade goes on in private groups rather than in the open, according to reports from the region. While Nigerian P2P exchanges experienced record growth recently, the prevalence of scammers in the country pushed many traders into dozens of informal venues on Telegram, where trusted members are only trading among themselves. These groups reportedly vet the IDs and banking documentation of anyone that wishes to join themselves, and are therefore hard to infiltrate. Actual transfers are also made in person, and in secluded places like homes or the back of small shops. What could the Senate of Nigeria find out about bitcoin trading in the country?

The recently launched RX Vega GPUs have virtually disappeared from shelves, with crypto mining gaining popularity among investors and enthusiasts. The revenue from the company’s Graphics Division has reached almost a billion dollars in the last quarter of 2017. Recognizing the shortages, AMD is trying to satisfy both gamers and miners. Also read: Hydro-Quebec Unable to Meet Energy Demand From Cryptocurrency Miners More GPU Power Needed Increasing interest in cryptocurrency mining during the past year has compelled companies like AMD to address the rising demand for hardware components. Skyrocketing prices of bitcoin and the other cryptos have lured many new investors and ordinary enthusiasts into the mining business. GPUs are used to mine altcoins like Ethereum and Monero which require more moderate computing power. The miners’ appetite has forced Nvidia, AMD’s main competitor, to take steps to ensure gamers have a chance to get hold of its video processors. It recently asked retailors to limit the number of graphics cards that can be purchased at a time. AMD also admitted that its Radeon cards were in short supply and acknowledged that mining applications were responsible for the shortfall. Promising to increase production, the company hopes to satisfy the growing demand without disappointing any of its customers. “The graphics channel is very low, and we are certainly working to replenish that environment”, said CEO Dr. Lisa Su, quoted by Polygon. Because the availability of graphics cards is “lower than we would like it to be,” she added: We are ramping up production. Her announcement represents a sharp turn after last fall when Lisa Su predicted that the demand from cryptocurrency miners would start to level off in Q4. “As we look at it,[crypto-related demand] continues to be a factor, but we’ve seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that. So we’re being a little bit conservative on the cryptocurrency side of the equation,” she said in October. Speaking to investors during a conference call, Dr. Su presented the latest corporate earnings report, referring to the cryptocurrency mining market as a good part of AMD’s business. Advanced Micro Devices has announced $1.48 billion USD of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. $958 million of that total came from its Computing and Graphics division, where the year-on-year increase reached 60%. Sales of graphics cards, like the new Vega 56 and Vega 64, have been a key factor. Short on Memory Though Other important players may influence AMD’s ability to make good on its promises to satisfy gamers and miners. While ramping up production, the company must take into account the already recognized shortages of RAM. GDDR5 and HBM2 – the two main types of memory used in its RX 400, 500 and the new RX Vega graphics cards – are also undersupplied. In that respect, AMD’s management assured investors and customers it would work with its partners to overcome the deficit. Retailers also have a say when it comes to priorities on the GPU market. Some of them have already signaled their intention to implement their own measures to prevent cryptocurrency miners from buying the bulk of the available graphics cards. They simply want to make sure that gamers get their share of the stock. Another crucial factor is the fluctuating demand for mining equipment that tends to follow the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market. The profitability of mining operations is highly dependent on the rates of the mined coins, as their prices affect the rate of return of mining projects.

Also Read:&#xA0;U.S. Regulators Send Tether and Bitfinex Subpoenas Supply of USDT Increases Significantly Following December 6th Subpoena Earlier this week, it was reported&#xA0;that Bitfinex and Tether had been sent subpoenas by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 6th, 2017. Although further details pertaining to the subpoenas have not surfaced, the dramatic explosion in the number of USDT in circulation witnessed last year despite Bitfinex and Tether&#x2019;s loss of banking partners in March has long called into question the integrity and transparency of both companies. From February 2017, the number of USDT in circulation has grown by nearly 9,000%, rising from approximately $25 million USD at the start of February last year to more than $2.25 billion at the end of January 2018 according to Coinmarketcap. Since receiving the subpoena, Tether increased the number of USDT by 775 million, comprising a 52.5% increase in the total supply from December 6th, 2017. As such, approximately 34.5% of all USDT created were produced after Tether had received the subpoena from the CFTC. Suspicions Grow Surrounding Bitfinex and Tether&#x2019;s Operations Widespread speculation has attributed the ramping up of USDT issuance to a last ditch attempt by Tether and Bitfinex to manipulate the BTC markets in light of the subpoena. Many sources have argued that much of the Tether created since December 6th may have been produced without USD backing, and then traded on exchanges to drive the price to record highs before the subpoena&#x2019;s existence could be revealed. Accusations of insider trading have consistently hounded Bitfinex throughout its lifespan. In early 2013 an apparently disgruntled former Bitfinex employee leaked an email correspondence between himself and the former CEO of Bitfinex, Raphael Nicolle. In the email, the employee alleges that the trading account for Bitfinex&#x2019;s current Chief Financial Officer, Giancarlo Devasini, &#x201C;was credited one million dollars, money that he didn&#x2019;t have deposited in his account.&#x201D; The statement issued by Bitfinex and Tether regarding the CFTC subpoena claims &#x201C;We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations. It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.&#x201D; Expanding Mandate of the CFTC News of the subpoena broke just days after Jay Clayton, the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and J. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the CFTC, co-authored an open letter discussing their outlook on the role of the regulatory institutions with regard to the cryptocurrency markets. In the letter, it is asserted that following the launch of CBOE and CME&#x2019;s respective bitcoin futures markets, the CFTC &#x201C;gained oversight over the U.S. bitcoin futures market and access to data that can facilitate the detection and pursuit of bad actors in underlying spot markets.&#x201D; What is your opinion on the controversy surrounding the operations of Bitfinex and Tether?

Over 100,000 people had applied to be whitelisted, and the anticipation in the group&#x2019;s Telegram channel was palpable. The moment the public sale launched on Monday, everything fell to pieces as phishing emails successfully stole over $400,000 in ether and counting. To compound matters, The Bee Token team went into denial about the extent of the problem, exacerbating the community&#x2019;s losses and causing widespread anger. Also read:&#xA0;Neo ICOs Make a Shaky Start The Bee Token Loses Its Buzz Up until yesterday, decentralized Airbnb platform The Bee Token was a textbook case in how to run a crowdsale. It had developed an engaged and passionate community, had performed meticulous KYC and whitelist verification, and had fairly set a low cap and low contribution limits of 0.1 to 0.2 ETH to allow as many people as possible to take part. Even so, the team had to turn a vast number of people away. The 100,000+ who applied for the crowdsale is believed to be a record and The Bee Token&#x2019;s Telegram channel has well over 50,000 followers. As soon as the public sale started, all that hard work was undone in minutes. At some stage in the past month, hackers managed to get hold of The Bee Token&#x2019;s vast email list including names and contribution addresses. Phishing emails were sent out, purporting to be from The Bee Token, convincing hundreds of people to contribute to the wrong address. The damage could have been limited had The Bee Token been frank with their community. Instead they dispatched the meekest of emails, noting &#x201C;The Bee Token has received reports of fake emails, Telegram accounts, etc. claiming to represent the Bee Token ICO Crowdsale&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s a sentence which will go down as an understatement of the century. Hackers Help Themselves to the Honeypot Around the same time as The Bee Token&#x2019;s mildly worded cautionary email was dropping, their mailing list was receiving the following phishing email: The scam had been well orchestrated, with recipients even addressed by their first name. Experienced heads had no trouble in seeing through the fraud in an instant, with its glaring typo, talk of a Microsoft partnership, promise of the token doubling in price, and sudden increase in the contribution limit. Crypto in 2018 has more newbs than veterans though, and investors fell for the scam in their droves. The original phishing address plus a second one that was used have amassed over $400,000 in ETH and counting. Some people sent as much as 30 ETH. Rather than warn users in its Telegram channel about the phishing scam being perpetuated, The Bee Token had the audacity to play it down and to accuse channel members of spreading FUD. On its Twitter, there was also precious little to indicate that there was a huge scam underway and that hundreds of people had already been duped. In a bid to quell any negative PR, The Bee Token took a bad situation and made it significantly worse. In addition to the email scam, it&#x2019;s been claimed that The Bee Token website was hacked at some stage, with users being redirected from the .com to a .org, though with The Bee Token denying everything, this is hard to verify. To Bee or Not to Bee? It had been expected that The Bee Token&#x2019;s crowdsale would sell out rapidly, but uptake today has been sluggish, either due to investors being wary or simply due to having no ETH to spare after sending it to the wrong address on Monday. The team&#x2019;s failure to secure hundreds of thousands of customer records and to then deflect and deny doesn&#x2019;t bode well for the project&#x2019;s future. By the time the Telegram channel had been overrun with spam bots, late on Monday night, admins were reduced to blanket deleting all replies, a provision which remains in place today. The Bee Token&#x2019;s sorry crowdsale takes the total ETH stolen this week from ICO phishing scams to well over half a million dollars, as Experty also succumbed to the same fate. There was also the case of the vegetables on the blockchain ICO which exit scammed recently. The wild west days of cryptocurrency haven&#x2019;t ended: they&#x2019;ve simply switched from bitcoin to ethereum where the newbs and the profits lie.

Also Read: Bitcoin Tax Reporting Software Developer Node40 Acquired for $8m IRS Tax Form San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has issued 1099-K tax forms for a certain segment of its clients in the US on January 31. The company explains that it files 1099-K for customers who have received cash above the required reporting threshold, which is more than 200 receipt transactions or greater than $20,000 during the year. This also includes &#8220;business use&#8221; accounts, as well as GDAX accounts in which sales of cryptocurrency for cash have occurred that exceed the thresholds. Business use is meant to apply only to those who received payments in exchange for the provision of goods or services, not mining proceeds or transfers from other wallets they hold. Coinbase states that: “We used the best data available to us to determine whether your account activity qualifies as Business Use, including but not limited to factors such as completion of a merchant profile or enabling merchant tools.” This is similar to Etsy sellers and Uber drivers who also file 1099-K forms. What Can You Do? Over at the crypto community&#8217;s online forums and social media, complaints are already popping up from Coinbase clients upset about the move. Besides the obvious displeasure of learning that their transactions will be reported to the IRS, people are complaining about not being notified beforehand and above all about the figures being higher than what they expected.

Consulting with a tax professional is advised as well. The fact that Coinbase would want to prevent more problems for itself with the IRS should not be surprising.

Edward Kelso\\', \\'Bitcoin futures regulators met for their first Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) of the new year, and it was dedicated exclusively to cryptocurrency futures. An advisory body to the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the not-quite two-year-old group held its only public meeting on the issue since bitcoin futures went live in December of last year. The all-day affair included commentary from regulators and futures market makers such as Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and all were asked about their impressions so far of bitcoin futures and the process of self-certification for exchanges. Also read: Nassim Nicholas Taleb vs David Birch on The Bitcoin Standard Market Risk Advisory Committee Holds First Public Meeting on Bitcoin Futures Since December 2017’s historic launching of two bitcoin futures markets on Cboe and CME, the verdict has been decidedly mixed depending upon the commenter. Bitcoiners hoped for a price run beyond 19,000 USD highs, but were soon to realize nothing close would be the case. The price in fact flattened and contract volume was slim. For professional traders and clearinghouses, the rush in December to take advantage of crypto fever seemed ill-conceived from the start, and soon contracts turned short as the price of bitcoin has essentially halved, leading to even more concern about volatility. Still other analysts believe the markets simply need to mature. Wednesday, 31 January 2018 held a first in Washington, DC: it’s both the date of the first meeting of MRAC and the first time CFTC has held a public meeting on bitcoin futures, bringing together market makers from Cboe, CME, and others. The effort is part of an ongoing conversation American regulators are beginning to have as cryptocurrency begins to increasingly dominate their discussions. At issue were the CFTC’s the statutory framework and regulatory process within the quirk of commodity exchanges’ self-certification; general discussion of the commission’s authority; oversight tools; product design and governance process of market makers for clearing new products and evaluating them post launch; and hearing from the market makers themselves about bitcoin futures’ roll out and the process thus far, including going forward. In a rather large closed circle gathering, attendees included Rostin Behnam, MRAC Sponsor and Commissioner, J. Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Julie Winkler, Chief Commercial Officer CME Group, Chris Concannon, President and Chief Operating Officer Cboe Futures Exchange, among many others. Informal Process Works Well “That informal process has worked well over the years,” CME’s Kathleen Cronin insisted, speaking to the issue of adding new rules or regulations on top of the existing structure. “To impose a formal process, I think, unnecessarily creates administrative burdens.” Indeed, in recent weeks Chairman Giancarlo suggested a process of “heightened review” for CFTC, and he and his staff reiterated as much throughout the meeting. A notable exception came from MRAC’s Rostin Behnam, who after acknowledging setbacks and exceptions, praised the status quo. “Self-certification is a unique process that has served market participants, the CFTC, and the general public very well,” Mr. Behnam began the morning’s session. “Indeed, since Congress authorized the CFTC to establish a self-certification process for the listing of new futures products in 2000, 15 exchanges have self-certified 10,628 new products, providing more risk management tools for commercial end-users across many different asset classes.” Both Mr. Concannon of Cboe and Ms. Winkler of CME were quick to point out the relative calm and frictionlessness of bitcoin futures markets, reminding regulators that neither market was rushed but was instead the work of many years in coordination with CFTC, brokers, clearinghouses, and the like. Both exchanges agreed self-certification allows them to be nimble in a globally competitive atmosphere, and places incentives where they need to be: at the exchange level. As if to pound home the point, CFTC’s Mr. Behnam thanked participants at the end of the meeting, pronouncing &#8220;self-certification works&#8221;.

Most people understand that the earlier they take Social Security, the less they\\'ll get. But the mechanics of how your full retirement age interacts with provisions that reduce early benefits, but increase monthly checks if you take them later, aren\\'t entirely clear to everyone in or nearing retirement.\\nIf you want to get the biggest possible monthly benefits from Social Security, you have to take advantage of the program\\'sdelayed retirement credits. Yet under current law, younger people\\'s ability to claim delayed retirement credits is being phased down, and future moves could limit credits even further.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe Social Security Administration designed delayed retirement credits to augment benefits for those who chose to wait beyond full retirement age before claiming their Social Security. In order to figure out how big your delayed retirement credit will be, you\\'ll need to follow this four-step process:\\n• Figure out how much your primary insurance amount would be. That\\'s the amount you would receive if you took your Social Security benefits right at your full retirement age.\\n• Look up what your full retirement age is. That age is 66 for those who are turning 66 in 2018 or who have done so in recent years.\\n• Decide how many months after your full retirement age you intend to start taking Social Security.\\n• For each month that you wait after full retirement age, increase your primary insurance amount by two-thirds of a percent.\\nAn example can help you see how this works. Say that your full retirement age is 66 and your earnings history would produce a $1,500 primary insurance amount. If you take Social Security right at 66, you\\'ll get $1,500 monthly. But say you want to wait until you turn 68. In that case, you\\'d take the number of months after your full retirement age, which is 24 months. Multiply 24 by two-thirds of a percent, and you\\'ll get 16%.\\nDoing the math, 16% of $1,500 is $240, so your delayed retirement credit will be $240, and you\\'ll get a total of $1,740 per month -- valued in today\\'s dollars and subject to future inflation -- if you wait two years before claiming your benefits. Wait until the maximum age of 70 -- beyond which no further delayed retirement credits are available -- and you\\'d get a 32% bump, to $1,980 per month.\\nDelayed retirement credits are available only to worker benefits under Social Security. Spousal benefits don\\'t qualify, so there\\'s no reason for a spouse intending to receive only spousal benefits to wait beyond full retirement age before making a claim and getting those monthly payments started. However, if a spouse could claim either spousal benefitsorwork benefits on the spouse\\'s own earnings history, then there could be reasons to hold off filing beyond full retirement age under current law.\\nAs you saw above, the largest number of delayed retirement credits for those who are reaching full retirement age now is 48 months, or a 32% increase to benefit amounts. That\\'s because the age beyond which new delayed retirement credits are no longer available is set at 70, regardless of what the full retirement age is.\\nChanges made to the Social Security program in the early 1980sraised the full retirement age. Early retirees are finding now that their full retirement age is higher than 66, with those turning 62 in 2018 having a full retirement age of 66 and four months. That will go up gradually over the next several years, topping out at 67 for those who were born in 1960 or later.\\nWhat that means for those considering delayed retirement credits is that there will be fewer of them to claim. If your full retirement age is 67, then the largest number of credits you can get is 36 months, because that\\'s the length of time between full retirement age and reaching age 70. That makes the maximum boost to your benefits 24% instead of 32%, working out to a loss of $120 in potential delayed retirement credits on a monthly basis.\\nDespite not being able to get as many delayed retirement credits, those who have a while left before retiring still should think about the ideal time to claim their benefits and consider waiting if they can. Even as the reward for waiting goes down, the penalty for claiming early is also going up. The net impact still makes it smart to wait if you want your monthly check to be as big as it can be.\\nFiguring out when to take Social Security has personal aspects to it, but you\\'ll also want to consider the financial implications. Understanding the ins and outs of delayed retirement credits will help you make a smarter choice.\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

That has dramatic implications for how new tax laws will affect the insurer in 2018 and beyond.\\nComing into Wednesday\\'s fourth-quarter financial report, Aflac investors believed that the company\\'s top line would take a big hit, but earnings were expected to be solid. The insurer got a nice boost from tax reform, and even when you take out that one-time impact, solid bottom-line performance on an adjusted basis set the stage for a good start in 2018. Let\\'s look more closely at Aflac and how it did to finish 2017.\\nImage source: Aflac.\\nAflac\\'s fourth-quarter results were mixed, as most shareholders had expected. Revenue plunged 9% to $5.42 billion, but that was slightly less dramatic than the roughly 10% decline that most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income more than tripled to $2.4 billion. After adjusting for special items, adjusted operating earnings of $1.63 per share were $0.08 better than the consensus among investors.\\nTax reform was a huge part of the reason Aflac\\'s bottom line rose so much. The company posted a $1.7 billion estimated benefit from tax reform, stemming in large part from expected lower tax rates on repatriated earnings from its Japanese unit. Aflac has been unusual in that it has typically brought back some capital from its overseas business even in the face of the higher tax rates that prevailed under previous law.\\nThe weaker yen again played a role in hurting Aflac\\'s revenue. The yen fell about 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-earlier period, with the dollar rising from 109.10 yen to 112.98 yen over that span. Aflac blamed the yen for $0.03 per share in operating earnings, which was a smaller impact than theinsurer has seen in previous periods.\\nAflac\\'s restructuring of its Japanese operations continued to weigh on performance as well. Local-currency premium income fell 3.3% in the quarter, with the insurer\\'s anticipated pullback from first-sector savings products within Japan weighing on the company\\'s ability to pick up new business in the more lucrative third-sector cancer, medical, and income support product category.

The Motley Fool recommends Aflac. The Motley Fool has adisclosure policy. || Tax reform has had a major impact on the current earnings season, as just about every company stands to see changes to its tax situation as a result of new rules on foreign earnings and lower corporate tax rates. Aflac (NYSE: AFL) is in an unusual situation, because even though most U.S. investors know the company as a provider of supplemental insurance products to workers throughout the country, Aflac gets most of its revenue from its Japanese business . That has dramatic implications for how new tax laws will affect the insurer in 2018 and beyond. Coming into Wednesday\\'s fourth-quarter financial report, Aflac investors believed that the company\\'s top line would take a big hit, but earnings were expected to be solid. The insurer got a nice boost from tax reform, and even when you take out that one-time impact, solid bottom-line performance on an adjusted basis set the stage for a good start in 2018. Let\\'s look more closely at Aflac and how it did to finish 2017. Aflac spokesduck holding blue mobile phone. Image source: Aflac. Aflac gets a gift Aflac\\'s fourth-quarter results were mixed, as most shareholders had expected. Revenue plunged 9% to $5.42 billion, but that was slightly less dramatic than the roughly 10% decline that most of those following the stock were looking to see. Net income more than tripled to $2.4 billion. After adjusting for special items, adjusted operating earnings of $1.63 per share were $0.08 better than the consensus among investors. Tax reform was a huge part of the reason Aflac\\'s bottom line rose so much. The company posted a $1.7 billion estimated benefit from tax reform, stemming in large part from expected lower tax rates on repatriated earnings from its Japanese unit. Aflac has been unusual in that it has typically brought back some capital from its overseas business even in the face of the higher tax rates that prevailed under previous law. The weaker yen again played a role in hurting Aflac\\'s revenue. The yen fell about 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-earlier period, with the dollar rising from 109.10 yen to 112.98 yen over that span. Aflac blamed the yen for $0.03 per share in operating earnings, which was a smaller impact than the insurer has seen in previous periods . Story continues Aflac\\'s restructuring of its Japanese operations continued to weigh on performance as well. Local-currency premium income fell 3.3% in the quarter, with the insurer\\'s anticipated pullback from first-sector savings products within Japan weighing on the company\\'s ability to pick up new business in the more lucrative third-sector cancer, medical, and income support product category. New annualized premium sales were down 8% in local terms, and it took a rise in net investment income to offset some of the falling fundamental performance for the Japanese unit. In the U.S., Aflac managed to post a 2% rise in premium income and total revenue. Pretax operating earnings climbed almost 10%, as better margin reflected cost controls. Total new annualized premium sales climbed almost 7% in the segment during the quarter. Can Aflac keep quacking? CEO Daniel Amos kept his comments relatively simple. \"We are pleased with the company\\'s overall performance for the year,\" Amos said, and he pointed to tax reform in giving Aflac \"an opportunity to accelerate and increase our investments in initiatives that reflect our company values and objectives.\" The CEO is also optimistic about its future, noting that challenges in Japan early in the year should give way to better performance in the second half, while the U.S. market should keep producing solid growth. In particular, Aflac intends to spend about $250 million on U.S. operations over the next three to five years.

Please go ahead.\\nMichael J. Viola--Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. As Tony said, I\\'m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&Ts Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&T\\'s Chief Financial Officer.

It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\\'re gonna be subject to risks, uncertainties, and results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.\\nAnd so now, I\\'d like to turn the call over to AT&T\\'s Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson.\\nRandall Stephenson--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay, thanks, Mike. What we\\'ll do is start on page four of the deck, and I just want to take a moment and reflect on 2017 because by any measure 2017 was a remarkable year. It was remarkable for our country, for our industry where we operate and for AT&T. And it\\'s been a long time since we\\'ve seen so many-what I would call-major public policy achievements compressed into a single year like we saw last year, and we\\'re calling these achievements because the combined impact from these is going to be growth. It\\'s going to be growth in US investment, in jobs, and in wages.\\nAnd all of this began early in 2017 as regulations across all industries were being rationalized. In our industry specifically, the FCC returned us to a light-touch regulation of the internet, and this was the approach that up until 2015 had allowed the internet to flourish and the US tech sector to lead the world in innovation. So, we, obviously, believe this was a step in the right direction, but this regulatory pendulum is gonna keep swinging back and forth unless Congress steps forward and writes new laws to govern all internet companies and to protect the consumer. We believe that we need clarity. We need a long-term predictability on the rules of the internet and on customer privacy. So, we\\'re calling for an internet bill of rights, and you can expect us to take a leadership role on this as the discussion progresses.\\nBut unquestionably the biggest development that came out of Washington last year was around tax reform. Our public policymakers pulled the greatest lever they had available to them to stimulate capital investment and job creation and wage growth. That lever was giving US companies a competitive tax system, one that levels the playing field with the rest of the world. We\\'re very early in the process, but you\\'ve seen it. Company after company is already announcing increased investment, hiring, wage increases, and employee bonuses. And we were first out of the gate. We announced bonuses for more than 200,000 frontline employees and a voluntary medical plan contribution for a total of $1 billion. And we also increased our 2018 capital expenditures by another $1 billion.\\nSo while public policy stole a lot of the spotlight, we did make a lot of progress on several strategic initiatives last year. The most important is FirstNet, winning that FirstNet bid, and this is gonna prove to be the foundation for taking wireless network performance to a completely new level. What we\\'re doing is building a nationwide network with the latest technology. It\\'s designed, and it\\'s hardened for America\\'s first responders.

Others, like Venezuela, have been forced to do so to battle out-of-control inflation that has crippled its economy. Opposed to a decentralized and anonymous system, the creation of a cryptocurrency that governments can control is their only option to wrestle back some semblance of ‘control’ that has been handed to the everyday man using cryptocurrencies.\\\\nSpeaking to RT at the WEF in Davos, Universa CEO Alexander Borodich said governments are keen to issue their own virtual currencies that would be backed by commodities like oil.\\\\n\\\\n“From my perspective, they will offer state country-wide cryptocurrencies like Cryptorruble or crypto-barrel if they like to… back the oil they have or other natural resources.”\\\\n\\\\nHe added that 2018 would see the emergence of these state-issued cryptocurrencies to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and other popular virtual currencies.\\\\nNefarious uses still a concern\\\\nDespite the best intentions of honest developers, exchanges and Blockchain engineers, there is a prevailing sentiment that the underworld still uses cryptocurrencies. It’s been a number of years since the closure of Silk Road and subsequent black markets, but heads of states are still citing concerns over the nefarious uses of virtual currencies.\\\\nAs quoted by the Independent, US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said there is a concerted effort being made to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for illicit trade.\\\\n\\\\n\"My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or Bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they\\\\\\'re not used for illicit activities.”\\\\n\\\\nA major concern is also the well-being of financial markets and systems that have been shaken up by the massive adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins in the past 12 months. In the words of Mnuchin:\\\\n\\\\n\"We encourage fintech and we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure all of our financial markets are safe. We want to make sure that the rest of the world -- and many of the (Group of) 20 countries are already starting on this -- have the same regulations.”\\\\n\\\\nIMF head Christine Lagarde also painted a harsh perception of cryptocurrencies.\\\\n\\\\n\"The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements.”\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, the cryptocurrency community has been bullish on social media, slamming the apathy swirling around at Davos this week.\\\\n\\'], [15051, \\'bitcoin-to-get-severely-forked-in-2018\\', 92106, \\'Bitcoin to Get Severely Forked in 2018\\', \\'2018-02-01 18:00:00\\', \\'Forking of Bitcoin’s original chain could become quite the trend in the coming year\\', \\'The fear and build up towards Aug. 1, 2017, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash which forked off the original chain was monumental. However, it was a damp squib for the future of Bitcoin as it actually spiked in value.\\\\nSince then, forks on Bitcoin have become almost as common as ICOs, and in fact, forks on the Bitcoin chain look to be the latest trend for 2018 as new companies look to cash in on the familiar Bitcoin name.\\\\nAlready a forking mess\\\\nBitcoin Cash is, of course, the most well known Bitcoin fork out there, sitting comfortably in the top five coins in terms of market cap. However, in 2017, there were 19 registered Bitcoin forks. Still, that pales in comparison to the 50 that are expected this year, according to Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.\\\\nThat number could still rise further as there is even services out there that are providing rudimentary programming skills to launch a clone. This will of course have a big effect in the cryptocurrency market as hedge fund manager Ari Paul predicted in a tweet:\\\\n\\\\n9/ Both BTC and BCH will continue to hard fork and >10% of the value of each (if held today) will reside in new offshoots.\\\\r\\\\n— Ari Paul (@AriDavidPaul) January 14, 2018\\\\n\\\\nWhat the fork?\\\\nThere are a number of reasons to fork off the Bitcoin Blockchain, some do it, in the case of Bitcoin Cash, to seemingly improve facets of the old coin, while others may have different motives. As George Kimionis, chief executive officer of Coinomi puts it:\\\\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab. Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases rather than honest attempts to contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem.”\\\\nKimionis also sees a new phase in the ICO marketplace with the original hype simmered down somewhat. Forking adds a little edge to a new coin. And Rhett Creighton, who’s working on the upcoming Bitcoin Private fork, predicts:\\\\n\\\\n“Bitcoin forks are kind of the new altcoin. We are going to see now a bunch of Bitcoin forks.

Each Envion unit is installed inside of a shipping container and can be powered by a solar or wind farm anywhere in the world, eliminating a reliance on any one country’s infrastructure.\\\\nAlmost 70 percent of the world’s cryptocurrency mining takes place not in Europe, but in China, due to the cheap electrical costs there. However, as China has recently been tightening up regulations on crypto trading in the country, banning ICOs and exchanges, there is concern that miners could face power restrictions in China.\\\\nAs CT reported in December 2017, standard Bitcoin mining globally uses more power than most African countries. With crypto mining in China based on either the use of coal or hydroelectric power, companies have tried innovative ways to use more renewable forms of energy, like a Netherlands-based company that tried to harness human body heat for mining purposes.\\\\n\\'], [15042, \\'fact-or-fud-pressure-drives-crypto-markets-down-almost-20\\', 104415, \\'Fact Or ‘FUD’?

However, it soon proved many in the mainstream wrong as it’s popularity and price skyrocketed.\\\\nBoth of these factors have caused regulators and governmental institutions to sit up and take notice. But more than that, they have been forced to take action in response. Regulators are indeed catching up to Bitcoin, as more and more hard-nosed approaches begin to make the news. It now looks as if the taxation authorities of some countries are also starting to get to grips with this fast moving, and mostly anonymous, monetary system/growing asset.\\\\nJust like death and taxes\\\\nIt is hardly confusing as to why the tax man would want to come knocking on the Bitcoin community’s door. The power of this digital currency, along with others, has handed huge amounts of growth and prosperity to investors, prosperity that has up til now, been largely kept off the grid.\\\\nThe amount of money, growth, and returns on investment mean that there is room for governments to stake their claim, but their methods in doing so are far more difficult in the grey area of crypto earnings. In normal circumstances, banks and other centralised financial institutions are obliged to disclose finances to taxation authorities. However, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin. There is currently no obligation on exchanges to disclose user information. In fact, it is unconstitutional in most settings, as the USA’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) found out when they requested data and were turned down by the courts.\\\\nAdditionally, Blockchain offers a transparent window into wallet addresses and transactions, but with anonymous IDs, these are no good to anyone trying to track down the owners of funds and their respective growth. This is also why there is a widely held fear of money laundering in the Bitcoin world.\\\\nHow do they do it — from US to Australia\\\\nGiven the difficulty in pegging down Bitcoin assets, different nations are trying different methods to try and claim tax from profits made by Bitcoin investors. The IRS, for example, has tried asking people nicely to declare their tax, and only 802 listened. The reset merely scoffed and remained in the shadows.\\\\nIn Australia, the government has deemed that cryptocurrencies are “a form of property”, and therefore: \"Any financial gains made from the selling of Bitcoin will generally be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) and must be reported to the Australian Tax Office,\" a spokesperson from the tax office said.\\\\nWhile this is still a grey area, there has been a warning issued. The Australian Tax Office has warned it will be looking out for tell-tale signs of crypto tax dodgers living beyond their means:\\\\n\\\\n\"The Australian Tax Office is here to help those that are genuinely trying to meet their tax obligations. However, where people attempt to deliberately avoid these obligations, we will take strong action.\"\\\\n\\\\nThis includes using \"a range of existing powers\" which are used to address \"unexplained wealth and conspicuous consumption that may arise through profits derived from cryptocurrency investment\".\\\\nThe South African Revenue Services (SARS) said in December last year that it would be exploring ways in which to track cryptocurrency trades in the hopes of addressing tax avoidance.\\\\xa0In the meantime, it is looking to provide its own guidance for citizens on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, its first foray into controlling the gains made. As Asheer Jaywant Ram, senior lecturer in the School of Accountancy at the University of the Witwatersrand, puts it:\\\\n\\\\n“I think there is enough interest and enough scope for SARS to be looking into this space, but now the question becomes, are they really going to accept taxpayers declaring their gains as capital gains tax or are they going to just say it is all revenue in nature?”\\\\n\\\\nIncome or capital?\\\\nThis is a key question that a lot of nations will have to put to the sword as, should it be taxed as income, as opposed to capital, it will be at a higher rate. Proving that it was indeed a long-term investment, and thus subject to gains tax, is far more difficult in the fast moving ecosystem that is Bitcoin. Ram adds:\\\\n\\\\n“Those sorts of debates on the nature of Bitcoin – I think those are coming – and I think it would be very interesting to actually see the outcome of those debates”\\\\n\\\\nIt is the very nature of cryptocurrencies that as they emerge more in the mainstream, they will be subjected to more scrutiny and regulations. While Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a disruptive force, scaring longstanding institutions such as banks, it is doubtful that they will be able to avoid tax forever. It would be more pertinent for a resolution to be met between tax authorities and crypto investors, lest there be bigger issues down the line.\\\\n\\']]\\n- Bitcoin News: [[106827, \\'2018-02-01 23:55:06\\', \\'Senate of Nigeria Launches Probe of Bitcoin Trading in the Country\\', \\'senate-of-nigeria-launches-probe-of-bitcoin-trading-in-the-country\\', \\'Avi Mizrahi\\', \\'Nigeria is known to have one of the biggest and fastest growing bitcoin markets in the whole of Africa.

Also Read: Bitcoin Tax Reporting Software Developer Node40 Acquired for $8m Nigerian Lawmakers Want to Know How to Control Bitcoin The Senate of Nigeria, the upper house of the Nigerian legislature, has ordered an investigation into bitcoin trading in the country. The Committee on Banking and Other Financial Institutions received two weeks to “investigate the viability of bitcoin as a form of investment” and “come up with recommendations on how to control its uses and trade,” Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu explained. The lawmakers also asked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to launch a campaign against the risks of trading bitcoin. The Senate urged these institutions to issue clear statements in all the dialects spoken in Nigeria about the dangers of storing value with cryptocurrency. This came after last week when CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said that: “Cryptocurrency or bitcoin is like a gamble, and there is a need for everybody to be very careful.” Private Trading Groups are Hard to Probe Unfortunately for those that want to control the uses and trade of bitcoin in Nigeria, the market in the country is more decentralized than most places and thus resilient towards outside influence. This is because a large volume of trade goes on in private groups rather than in the open, according to reports from the region. While Nigerian P2P exchanges experienced record growth recently, the prevalence of scammers in the country pushed many traders into dozens of informal venues on Telegram, where trusted members are only trading among themselves. These groups reportedly vet the IDs and banking documentation of anyone that wishes to join themselves, and are therefore hard to infiltrate. Actual transfers are also made in person, and in secluded places like homes or the back of small shops. What could the Senate of Nigeria find out about bitcoin trading in the country?

The recently launched RX Vega GPUs have virtually disappeared from shelves, with crypto mining gaining popularity among investors and enthusiasts. The revenue from the company’s Graphics Division has reached almost a billion dollars in the last quarter of 2017. Recognizing the shortages, AMD is trying to satisfy both gamers and miners. Also read: Hydro-Quebec Unable to Meet Energy Demand From Cryptocurrency Miners More GPU Power Needed Increasing interest in cryptocurrency mining during the past year has compelled companies like AMD to address the rising demand for hardware components. Skyrocketing prices of bitcoin and the other cryptos have lured many new investors and ordinary enthusiasts into the mining business. GPUs are used to mine altcoins like Ethereum and Monero which require more moderate computing power. The miners’ appetite has forced Nvidia, AMD’s main competitor, to take steps to ensure gamers have a chance to get hold of its video processors. It recently asked retailors to limit the number of graphics cards that can be purchased at a time. AMD also admitted that its Radeon cards were in short supply and acknowledged that mining applications were responsible for the shortfall. Promising to increase production, the company hopes to satisfy the growing demand without disappointing any of its customers. “The graphics channel is very low, and we are certainly working to replenish that environment”, said CEO Dr. Lisa Su, quoted by Polygon. Because the availability of graphics cards is “lower than we would like it to be,” she added: We are ramping up production. Her announcement represents a sharp turn after last fall when Lisa Su predicted that the demand from cryptocurrency miners would start to level off in Q4. “As we look at it,[crypto-related demand] continues to be a factor, but we’ve seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that. So we’re being a little bit conservative on the cryptocurrency side of the equation,” she said in October. Speaking to investors during a conference call, Dr. Su presented the latest corporate earnings report, referring to the cryptocurrency mining market as a good part of AMD’s business. Advanced Micro Devices has announced $1.48 billion USD of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. $958 million of that total came from its Computing and Graphics division, where the year-on-year increase reached 60%. Sales of graphics cards, like the new Vega 56 and Vega 64, have been a key factor. Short on Memory Though Other important players may influence AMD’s ability to make good on its promises to satisfy gamers and miners. While ramping up production, the company must take into account the already recognized shortages of RAM. GDDR5 and HBM2 – the two main types of memory used in its RX 400, 500 and the new RX Vega graphics cards – are also undersupplied. In that respect, AMD’s management assured investors and customers it would work with its partners to overcome the deficit. Retailers also have a say when it comes to priorities on the GPU market. Some of them have already signaled their intention to implement their own measures to prevent cryptocurrency miners from buying the bulk of the available graphics cards. They simply want to make sure that gamers get their share of the stock. Another crucial factor is the fluctuating demand for mining equipment that tends to follow the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market. The profitability of mining operations is highly dependent on the rates of the mined coins, as their prices affect the rate of return of mining projects.

Also Read:&#xA0;U.S. Regulators Send Tether and Bitfinex Subpoenas Supply of USDT Increases Significantly Following December 6th Subpoena Earlier this week, it was reported&#xA0;that Bitfinex and Tether had been sent subpoenas by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 6th, 2017. Although further details pertaining to the subpoenas have not surfaced, the dramatic explosion in the number of USDT in circulation witnessed last year despite Bitfinex and Tether&#x2019;s loss of banking partners in March has long called into question the integrity and transparency of both companies. From February 2017, the number of USDT in circulation has grown by nearly 9,000%, rising from approximately $25 million USD at the start of February last year to more than $2.25 billion at the end of January 2018 according to Coinmarketcap. Since receiving the subpoena, Tether increased the number of USDT by 775 million, comprising a 52.5% increase in the total supply from December 6th, 2017. As such, approximately 34.5% of all USDT created were produced after Tether had received the subpoena from the CFTC. Suspicions Grow Surrounding Bitfinex and Tether&#x2019;s Operations Widespread speculation has attributed the ramping up of USDT issuance to a last ditch attempt by Tether and Bitfinex to manipulate the BTC markets in light of the subpoena. Many sources have argued that much of the Tether created since December 6th may have been produced without USD backing, and then traded on exchanges to drive the price to record highs before the subpoena&#x2019;s existence could be revealed. Accusations of insider trading have consistently hounded Bitfinex throughout its lifespan. In early 2013 an apparently disgruntled former Bitfinex employee leaked an email correspondence between himself and the former CEO of Bitfinex, Raphael Nicolle. In the email, the employee alleges that the trading account for Bitfinex&#x2019;s current Chief Financial Officer, Giancarlo Devasini, &#x201C;was credited one million dollars, money that he didn&#x2019;t have deposited in his account.&#x201D; The statement issued by Bitfinex and Tether regarding the CFTC subpoena claims &#x201C;We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations. It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.&#x201D; Expanding Mandate of the CFTC News of the subpoena broke just days after Jay Clayton, the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and J.

In the letter, it is asserted that following the launch of CBOE and CME&#x2019;s respective bitcoin futures markets, the CFTC &#x201C;gained oversight over the U.S. bitcoin futures market and access to data that can facilitate the detection and pursuit of bad actors in underlying spot markets.&#x201D; What is your opinion on the controversy surrounding the operations of Bitfinex and Tether?

Over 100,000 people had applied to be whitelisted, and the anticipation in the group&#x2019;s Telegram channel was palpable. The moment the public sale launched on Monday, everything fell to pieces as phishing emails successfully stole over $400,000 in ether and counting. To compound matters, The Bee Token team went into denial about the extent of the problem, exacerbating the community&#x2019;s losses and causing widespread anger. Also read:&#xA0;Neo ICOs Make a Shaky Start The Bee Token Loses Its Buzz Up until yesterday, decentralized Airbnb platform The Bee Token was a textbook case in how to run a crowdsale. It had developed an engaged and passionate community, had performed meticulous KYC and whitelist verification, and had fairly set a low cap and low contribution limits of 0.1 to 0.2 ETH to allow as many people as possible to take part. Even so, the team had to turn a vast number of people away. The 100,000+ who applied for the crowdsale is believed to be a record and The Bee Token&#x2019;s Telegram channel has well over 50,000 followers. As soon as the public sale started, all that hard work was undone in minutes. At some stage in the past month, hackers managed to get hold of The Bee Token&#x2019;s vast email list including names and contribution addresses. Phishing emails were sent out, purporting to be from The Bee Token, convincing hundreds of people to contribute to the wrong address. The damage could have been limited had The Bee Token been frank with their community. Instead they dispatched the meekest of emails, noting &#x201C;The Bee Token has received reports of fake emails, Telegram accounts, etc. claiming to represent the Bee Token ICO Crowdsale&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s a sentence which will go down as an understatement of the century. Hackers Help Themselves to the Honeypot Around the same time as The Bee Token&#x2019;s mildly worded cautionary email was dropping, their mailing list was receiving the following phishing email: The scam had been well orchestrated, with recipients even addressed by their first name. Experienced heads had no trouble in seeing through the fraud in an instant, with its glaring typo, talk of a Microsoft partnership, promise of the token doubling in price, and sudden increase in the contribution limit. Crypto in 2018 has more newbs than veterans though, and investors fell for the scam in their droves. The original phishing address plus a second one that was used have amassed over $400,000 in ETH and counting. Some people sent as much as 30 ETH. Rather than warn users in its Telegram channel about the phishing scam being perpetuated, The Bee Token had the audacity to play it down and to accuse channel members of spreading FUD. On its Twitter, there was also precious little to indicate that there was a huge scam underway and that hundreds of people had already been duped. In a bid to quell any negative PR, The Bee Token took a bad situation and made it significantly worse. In addition to the email scam, it&#x2019;s been claimed that The Bee Token website was hacked at some stage, with users being redirected from the .com to a .org, though with The Bee Token denying everything, this is hard to verify. To Bee or Not to Bee? It had been expected that The Bee Token&#x2019;s crowdsale would sell out rapidly, but uptake today has been sluggish, either due to investors being wary or simply due to having no ETH to spare after sending it to the wrong address on Monday. The team&#x2019;s failure to secure hundreds of thousands of customer records and to then deflect and deny doesn&#x2019;t bode well for the project&#x2019;s future. By the time the Telegram channel had been overrun with spam bots, late on Monday night, admins were reduced to blanket deleting all replies, a provision which remains in place today. The Bee Token&#x2019;s sorry crowdsale takes the total ETH stolen this week from ICO phishing scams to well over half a million dollars, as Experty also succumbed to the same fate. There was also the case of the vegetables on the blockchain ICO which exit scammed recently. The wild west days of cryptocurrency haven&#x2019;t ended: they&#x2019;ve simply switched from bitcoin to ethereum where the newbs and the profits lie.

The company explains that it files 1099-K for customers who have received cash above the required reporting threshold, which is more than 200 receipt transactions or greater than $20,000 during the year. This also includes &#8220;business use&#8221; accounts, as well as GDAX accounts in which sales of cryptocurrency for cash have occurred that exceed the thresholds. Business use is meant to apply only to those who received payments in exchange for the provision of goods or services, not mining proceeds or transfers from other wallets they hold. Coinbase states that: “We used the best data available to us to determine whether your account activity qualifies as Business Use, including but not limited to factors such as completion of a merchant profile or enabling merchant tools.” This is similar to Etsy sellers and Uber drivers who also file 1099-K forms. What Can You Do? Over at the crypto community&#8217;s online forums and social media, complaints are already popping up from Coinbase clients upset about the move.

Edward Kelso\\', \\'Bitcoin futures regulators met for their first Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) of the new year, and it was dedicated exclusively to cryptocurrency futures. An advisory body to the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the not-quite two-year-old group held its only public meeting on the issue since bitcoin futures went live in December of last year. The all-day affair included commentary from regulators and futures market makers such as Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and all were asked about their impressions so far of bitcoin futures and the process of self-certification for exchanges. Also read: Nassim Nicholas Taleb vs David Birch on The Bitcoin Standard Market Risk Advisory Committee Holds First Public Meeting on Bitcoin Futures Since December 2017’s historic launching of two bitcoin futures markets on Cboe and CME, the verdict has been decidedly mixed depending upon the commenter. Bitcoiners hoped for a price run beyond 19,000 USD highs, but were soon to realize nothing close would be the case. The price in fact flattened and contract volume was slim. For professional traders and clearinghouses, the rush in December to take advantage of crypto fever seemed ill-conceived from the start, and soon contracts turned short as the price of bitcoin has essentially halved, leading to even more concern about volatility. Still other analysts believe the markets simply need to mature. Wednesday, 31 January 2018 held a first in Washington, DC: it’s both the date of the first meeting of MRAC and the first time CFTC has held a public meeting on bitcoin futures, bringing together market makers from Cboe, CME, and others. The effort is part of an ongoing conversation American regulators are beginning to have as cryptocurrency begins to increasingly dominate their discussions. At issue were the CFTC’s the statutory framework and regulatory process within the quirk of commodity exchanges’ self-certification; general discussion of the commission’s authority; oversight tools; product design and governance process of market makers for clearing new products and evaluating them post launch; and hearing from the market makers themselves about bitcoin futures’ roll out and the process thus far, including going forward. In a rather large closed circle gathering, attendees included Rostin Behnam, MRAC Sponsor and Commissioner, J. Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Julie Winkler, Chief Commercial Officer CME Group, Chris Concannon, President and Chief Operating Officer Cboe Futures Exchange, among many others. Informal Process Works Well “That informal process has worked well over the years,” CME’s Kathleen Cronin insisted, speaking to the issue of adding new rules or regulations on top of the existing structure. “To impose a formal process, I think, unnecessarily creates administrative burdens.” Indeed, in recent weeks Chairman Giancarlo suggested a process of “heightened review” for CFTC, and he and his staff reiterated as much throughout the meeting. A notable exception came from MRAC’s Rostin Behnam, who after acknowledging setbacks and exceptions, praised the status quo. “Self-certification is a unique process that has served market participants, the CFTC, and the general public very well,” Mr. Behnam began the morning’s session. “Indeed, since Congress authorized the CFTC to establish a self-certification process for the listing of new futures products in 2000, 15 exchanges have self-certified 10,628 new products, providing more risk management tools for commercial end-users across many different asset classes.” Both Mr. Concannon of Cboe and Ms. Winkler of CME were quick to point out the relative calm and frictionlessness of bitcoin futures markets, reminding regulators that neither market was rushed but was instead the work of many years in coordination with CFTC, brokers, clearinghouses, and the like. Both exchanges agreed self-certification allows them to be nimble in a globally competitive atmosphere, and places incentives where they need to be: at the exchange level. As if to pound home the point, CFTC’s Mr. Behnam thanked participants at the end of the meeting, pronouncing &#8220;self-certification works&#8221;. In only a few days time, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and CFTC will appear in a Senate hearing titled Virtual Currencies: The Oversight Role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 6 February 2018.

(Right now, that is 18 million USD/day for BTC miners, 2.7 million USD/day for BCH miners.)\\\\n\\\\nAll other numbers that we can get are basically meaningless, or cannot be interpreted without information that is not available.  \\\\n\\\\...\\n\\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\\nWhen you take Social Security plays a vital role in how much you\\'ll receive in benefits from the program. Most people understand that the earlier they take Social Security, the less they\\'ll get. But the mechanics of how your full retirement age interacts with provisions that reduce early benefits, but increase monthly checks if you take them later, aren\\'t entirely clear to everyone in or nearing retirement.\\nIf you want to get the biggest possible monthly benefits from Social Security, you have to take advantage of the program\\'sdelayed retirement credits. Yet under current law, younger people\\'s ability to claim delayed retirement credits is being phased down, and future moves could limit credits even further.\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe Social Security Administration designed delayed retirement credits to augment benefits for those who chose to wait beyond full retirement age before claiming their Social Security. In order to figure out how big your delayed retirement credit will be, you\\'ll need to follow this four-step process:\\n• Figure out how much your primary insurance amount would be. That\\'s the amount you would receive if you took your Social Security benefits right at your full retirement age.\\n• Look up what your full retirement age is. That age is 66 for those who are turning 66 in 2018 or who have done so in recent years.\\n• Decide how many months after your full retirement age you intend to start taking Social Security.\\n• For each month that you wait after full retirement age, increase your primary insurance amount by two-thirds of a percent.\\nAn example can help you see how this works. Say that your full retirement age is 66 and your earnings history would produce a $1,500 primary insurance amount. If you take Social Security right at 66, you\\'ll get $1,500 monthly. But say you want to wait until you turn 68. In that case, you\\'d take the number of months after your full retirement age, which is 24 months. Multiply 24 by two-thirds of a percent, and you\\'ll get 16%.\\nDoing the math, 16% of $1,500 is $240, so your delayed retirement credit will be $240, and you\\'ll get a total of $1,740 per month -- valued in today\\'s dollars and subject to future inflation -- if you wait two years before claiming your benefits. Wait until the maximum age of 70 -- beyond which no further delayed retirement credits are available -- and you\\'d get a 32% bump, to $1,980 per month.\\nDelayed retirement credits are available only to worker benefits under Social Security. Spousal benefits don\\'t qualify, so there\\'s no reason for a spouse intending to receive only spousal benefits to wait beyond full retirement age before making a claim and getting those monthly payments started. However, if a spouse could claim either spousal benefitsorwork benefits on the spouse\\'s own earnings history, then there could be reasons to hold off filing beyond full retirement age under current law.\\nAs you saw above, the largest number of delayed retirement credits for those who are reaching full retirement age now is 48 months, or a 32% increase to benefit amounts. That\\'s because the age beyond which new delayed retirement credits are no longer available is set at 70, regardless of what the full retirement age is.\\nChanges made to the Social Security program in the early 1980sraised the full retirement age. Early retirees are finding now that their full retirement age is higher than 66, with those turning 62 in 2018 having a full retirement age of 66 and four months. That will go up gradually over the next several years, topping out at 67 for those who were born in 1960 or later.\\nWhat that means for those considering delayed retirement credits is that there will be fewer of them to claim. If your full retirement age is 67, then the largest number of credits you can get is 36 months, because that\\'s the length of time between full retirement age and reaching age 70. That makes the maximum boost to your benefits 24% instead of 32%, working out to a loss of $120 in potential delayed retirement credits on a monthly basis.\\nDespite not being able to get as many delayed retirement credits, those who have a while left before retiring still should think about the ideal time to claim their benefits and consider waiting if they can. Even as the reward for waiting goes down, the penalty for claiming early is also going up. The net impact still makes it smart to wait if you want your monthly check to be as big as it can be.\\nFiguring out when to take Social Security has personal aspects to it, but you\\'ll also want to consider the financial implications. Understanding the ins and outs of delayed retirement credits will help you make a smarter choice.\\nMore From The Motley Fool\\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.
