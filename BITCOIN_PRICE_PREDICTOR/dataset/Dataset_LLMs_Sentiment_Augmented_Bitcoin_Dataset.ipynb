              " 'By Michelle Price HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong\\'s central bank has warned people against investing in virtual currencies amid local media reports that a bitcoin exchange may have run off with $387 million in client funds - making it potentially the biggest bitcoin scandal after last year\\'s bankruptcy at Tokyo-based Mt.Gox. The South China Morning Post reported on Monday that clients of Hong Kong-based MyCoin had approached a local lawmaker alleging the company absconded with their money. An assistant for Legislative Council member Leung Yiu-chung told Reuters that Leung had received more than 15 complaints from MyCoin clients regarding the alleged fraud, and these would be passed on to the police on Wednesday. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said in a statement late on Monday that the case \"may involve fraud or pyramid schemes,\" adding: \"Given the highly speculative nature of Bitcoin, we have all along urged the public to exercise extra caution when considering making transactions or investments with Bitcoin.\" Calls to MyCoin in Hong Kong could not be connected. Calls to the company\\'s China customer service line were not answered. Bitcoins are created through a \\'mining\\' process where a computer\\'s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. Advocates say the virtual currency is revolutionary as it\\'s not controlled by a central bank and has potential as an alternative means of online payment. But the rise of bitcoin, which is unregulated in many countries including Hong Kong, has stoked concerns it can be used as a vehicle to launder money and finance extremist groups. Mt.Gox, once the world\\'s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy a year ago after it claimed to have lost around $500 million worth of customer bitcoins in a hacking attack. On its website, MyCoin claims to be a \"leading global Bitcoin trading platform and application service provider,\" with a China-based research and development team. Story continues MyCoin promised clients a HK$1 million ($128,976) return over a 4-month period based on a HK$400,000 investment that would produce 90 bitcoins on maturity, the South China Morning Post reported, adding MyCoin claimed to have 3,000 customers each investing an average of HK$1 million. The price of a bitcoin has slumped from a late-2013 high of above $1,000 to around $220, according to CoinDesk\\'s price index.

Analyze the provided news and historical price data to make your forecast.\\n\\n**Today\\'s Key News:**\\n[\\'The major Asia-Pacific stock indexes were lower across the board on Thursday with China bucking the trend to move modestly higher. The weakness in the East wasn’t nearly as bad as the routs in the United States and Europe the previous sessions, as Asia’s brighter economic outlook offset investor worries about fresh COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe. In the cash market on Thursday, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index settled at 23331.94, down 86.57 or -0.37%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index finished at 24550.17, down 158.63 or -0.64% and South Korea’s KOSPI Index closed at 2326.67, down 18.59 or -0.79%. Bank of Japan Trims Growth, Price Forecasts; Keeps Policy Steady The Bank of Japan on Thursday trimmed its economic and price forecasts for the current fiscal year ending in March 2021, heightening expectations it will maintain its massive stimulus for a time being to cushion the blow from COVID-19. As widely expected, the central bank kept monetary policy steady, including a -0.1% target for short-term interest rates and a pledge to guide long-term rates around 0%. It also made no changes to a package of measures to ease corporate funding strains caused by the coronavirus pandemic. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is expected to hold a news conference to explain the policy decision and the new forecasts, which were produced as part of the BOJ’s quarterly report on the economic and price outlook. Samsung Predicts Fourth-Quarter Decline in Profits Due to Weak Demand and Growing Competition Shares in South Korea were among the biggest losers regionally, as the KOSPI Index fell as much as 1.69% before settling 0.79% lower. Shares of industry heavyweight Samsung Electronics declined around 2% after the firm on Thursday predicted a fourth-quarter decline in profits. Samsung Electronics on Thursday said it expects a decline in profit in the three months that will end on December 31 due to weak memory chip demand and intense competition in the smartphone and consumer electronics spaces. Story continues Samsung announced a 59% year-on-year jump in operating profit to 12.35 trillion Korean won (about $10.89 billion) for the July-September quarter, which was in line with earlier guidance. “Looking ahead, Samsung Electronics expects profit to decline in the fourth quarter amid weakening memory chip demand from server customers and intensifying competition in mobile phones and consumer electronics,” the company said in a statement. Sony Shares Pop on Strong Outlook Shares of Sony surged in Tokyo on Thursday, a day after the Japanese electronics giant raised its annual profit forecast. Sony shares in Japan were up 6.69% on Thursday even though Japan’s border index, the Nikkei 225, fell 0.37% on the day., On Wednesday, Sony raised its forecast for its annual operating income by 13% to 700 billion yen (approximately $6.7 billion). It came as the firm announced an operating profit of about 317.8 billion yen (around $3.04 billion) for the three months ended September 30.

The program has been under development for more than one year and has been used in beta mode with positive results. As with other platforms developed by DataNavee, the program uses AI to sort through reams of data that includes not only the trading history of the currencies, but also both macro- and micro-economic data, world events, and global money flows. Bringing all of this data into one program gives the user an ability to predict small and large changes in pricing direction with a high correlation to actual price moves. The program is anticipated to be offered before the end of the calendar year on a subscription basis to any individual for a low introductory fee designed to attract a maximum number of users. Initially the program will make detailed information available for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and additional currencies will be added over time. Several additional predictive analytic features will be added to the program after the initial launch that can be separately subscribed for in various options packages by the individual user. With a renewed interest globally in the value of crypto currencies as an alternative store of value to fiat currency, DataNavee estimates the potential user base for a program such as this could measure into the millions of individuals. The program will initially be launched in North America after which, countries will be added on a monthly basis.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the country would implementtough new business restrictions, and French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to impose a national lockdown.\\\\nRelated:Mirage Recovery: What ‘Record’ GDP Growth Tells Us About the Economy\\\\nSuch restrictions could crimp economic growth, theoretically a deflationary development, which could reduce demand for bitcoin in the short term as a hedge against higher consumer prices.

(TSX-V: DMGI) (DMGGF:OTC US) (FRANKFURT:6AX) (“DMG” or the “Company”), a diversified blockchain and technology company, is pleased to announce the launch of a new North America-based Bitcoin mining pool from its USA subsidiary company Blockseer.\\\\nHighlights:\\\\n• Blockseer’s new Bitcoin mining pool will be North America’s first bitcoin mining pool that will not only meet, but exceed the US Government’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance for BTC addresses, as well as providing the utmost level of transparency, auditability and corporate governance.\\\\n• Blockseer’s pool may further decentralize the bitcoin blockchain, readjusting the balance of hash rate to North America, where more Bitcoin nodes operate.\\\\n• Blockseer’s pool integrates DMG’s existing proprietary crypto forensics data, including Walletscore, to ensure that transaction blocks are OFAC compliant, as well as other risk factors that Walletscore tracks and manages\\\\n• Blockseer’s pool is integrated into DMG’s core technology platform, bringing all of DMG’s mine manager features into the pool, and providing an integrated User Experience for our customers.\\\\nCrypto-mining pools are the software protocols by which all miners connect to the various blockchains. Bitcoin mining pools generate revenue by charging fees to miners, usually between 1% to 3% of the total bitcoin mined. Miners contribute their hash rate to the pools and receive bitcoin rewards proportional to the total hash rate they contribute.\\\\nOver the past two years, DMG has worked with various accounting and legal firms as technical experts to investigate and test data from various mining pools, as there is currently no requirement for private pools to meet any data or reporting standards. Blockseer’s pool is focused on meeting such standards so that users can be assured that proper governance is in place for reliable data reported in a transparent way with third party independent verification.\\\\nAll users of Blockseer’s pool are required to pass KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, and blocks posted to the Bitcoin blockchain by Blockseer’s pool will only contain filtered transactions using Blockseer and Walletscore’s labeling data, along with verified sources such as the United States OFAC blacklist for crypto. Blockseer’s data analytics platform has been used by various law enforcement agencies over the past six years, providing Blockseer’s new pool with credible data relating to fraud, theft, money laundering and various other nefarious dealings which will be filtered out of any block that this pool will post to the Bitcoin blockchain.. Blockseer has a US patent pending novel approach to transaction filtering which examines transactions to and from bitcoin wallets which will exclude high risk wallets from being included in Blockseer’s posted blocks.\\\\nDMG’s CTO Adrian Glover commented “I am very proud of the work of our development team over the past year, to build and launch Blockseer’s pool platform. We built the pool on the technology platform that drives our mine management platform, thus creating a unified user experience for our customers, and enabling us to quickly add features to both products. In the near-term future, we will be providing audit ready reports and irrefutable proof of our customers’ mining revenue, directly from our user interface. For DMG, the launch of the pool is only the beginning, our team will continue to work hard on adding all of the revenue, cost tracking and projection information that miners look for. Following the same philosophy which we used in building our mine management platform, we built the pool we wished our vendors had provided for us.”\\\\nDMG’s COO Sheldon Bennett added, “I have personally led the forensic practice at DMG and have worked on multiple audits of publicly listed mining companies. We recognized early on the need for a mining pool that provided data that meets the needs of financial audits. However, it is not just public companies who need better transparency in pools, but any company or individual that sees the value in higher corporate governance through independent assurance of mining pool operations, fees and data. Blockseer’s pool brings a new compliance-focused standard to the industry, not only in the data the pool provides to its users, but also in the Bitcoin blocks it mines on the network. The pool is focused on being devoid of transaction from known nefarious wallets which use this medium in ways that continue to sully the reputation of crypto currencies, specifically Bitcoin, in the mainstream as well as to impede widespread adoption. Blockseer’s pool will be the first of its kind focused on governance, transparency and building Bitcoin blocks on the network, which are not primarily focused on transaction fees first but on sound transaction data and history.”\\\\nBlockseer’s pool platform is currently in private beta, with a public beta coming shortly. For those who are interested in signing up for the public beta, please go tohttps://dmgblockchain.com/contactto initiate the KYC process.\\\\nAbout DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.\\\\nDMG is a diversified cryptocurrency and blockchain platform company which is focused on the two primary opportunities in the sector – mining public blockchains and applying permissioned blockchain technology.

(TSX-V: DMGI) (DMGGF:OTC US) (FRANKFURT: 6AX ) (“DMG” or the “Company”), a diversified blockchain and technology company, is pleased to announce the launch of a new North America-based Bitcoin mining pool from its USA subsidiary company Blockseer. Highlights: Blockseer’s new Bitcoin mining pool will be North America’s first bitcoin mining pool that will not only meet, but exceed the US Government’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance for BTC addresses, as well as providing the utmost level of transparency, auditability and corporate governance. Blockseer’s pool may further decentralize the bitcoin blockchain, readjusting the balance of hash rate to North America, where more Bitcoin nodes operate. Blockseer’s pool integrates DMG’s existing proprietary crypto forensics data, including Walletscore, to ensure that transaction blocks are OFAC compliant, as well as other risk factors that Walletscore tracks and manages Blockseer’s pool is integrated into DMG’s core technology platform, bringing all of DMG’s mine manager features into the pool, and providing an integrated User Experience for our customers. Crypto-mining pools are the software protocols by which all miners connect to the various blockchains. Bitcoin mining pools generate revenue by charging fees to miners, usually between 1% to 3% of the total bitcoin mined. Miners contribute their hash rate to the pools and receive bitcoin rewards proportional to the total hash rate they contribute. Over the past two years, DMG has worked with various accounting and legal firms as technical experts to investigate and test data from various mining pools, as there is currently no requirement for private pools to meet any data or reporting standards. Blockseer’s pool is focused on meeting such standards so that users can be assured that proper governance is in place for reliable data reported in a transparent way with third party independent verification. All users of Blockseer’s pool are required to pass KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, and blocks posted to the Bitcoin blockchain by Blockseer’s pool will only contain filtered transactions using Blockseer and Walletscore’s labeling data, along with verified sources such as the United States OFAC blacklist for crypto. Blockseer’s data analytics platform has been used by various law enforcement agencies over the past six years, providing Blockseer’s new pool with credible data relating to fraud, theft, money laundering and various other nefarious dealings which will be filtered out of any block that this pool will post to the Bitcoin blockchain.. Blockseer has a US patent pending novel approach to transaction filtering which examines transactions to and from bitcoin wallets which will exclude high risk wallets from being included in Blockseer’s posted blocks. Story continues DMG’s CTO Adrian Glover commented “I am very proud of the work of our development team over the past year, to build and launch Blockseer’s pool platform. We built the pool on the technology platform that drives our mine management platform, thus creating a unified user experience for our customers, and enabling us to quickly add features to both products. In the near-term future, we will be providing audit ready reports and irrefutable proof of our customers’ mining revenue, directly from our user interface. For DMG, the launch of the pool is only the beginning, our team will continue to work hard on adding all of the revenue, cost tracking and projection information that miners look for. Following the same philosophy which we used in building our mine management platform, we built the pool we wished our vendors had provided for us.” DMG’s COO Sheldon Bennett added, “I have personally led the forensic practice at DMG and have worked on multiple audits of publicly listed mining companies. We recognized early on the need for a mining pool that provided data that meets the needs of financial audits. However, it is not just public companies who need better transparency in pools, but any company or individual that sees the value in higher corporate governance through independent assurance of mining pool operations, fees and data. Blockseer’s pool brings a new compliance-focused standard to the industry, not only in the data the pool provides to its users, but also in the Bitcoin blocks it mines on the network. The pool is focused on being devoid of transaction from known nefarious wallets which use this medium in ways that continue to sully the reputation of crypto currencies, specifically Bitcoin, in the mainstream as well as to impede widespread adoption. Blockseer’s pool will be the first of its kind focused on governance, transparency and building Bitcoin blocks on the network, which are not primarily focused on transaction fees first but on sound transaction data and history.” Blockseer’s pool platform is currently in private beta, with a public beta coming shortly.

Citing an article from The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Iran Daily reported earlier this week the country’s cabinet has amended recent legislation on digital assets to allow cryptocurrency to be used for import funding by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). The amendment had been jointly proposed by the CBI and the cabinet previously. The change means legally mined cryptocurrency in Iran can only be exchanged if used to fund imports from other nations. Miners will supply the cryptocurrency directly to the CBI within an authorized limit, per IRNA’s report. This would be based on how much subsidized energy a miner uses, as well as instructions to be published by the Ministry of Energy. Cryptocurrency has become increasingly important in Iran as the nation suffers from economic woes brought by U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic. Mining was legalized last year , however the industry is heavily regulated by the government making it a tough jurisdiction in which to operatate.

Partners, such as exchanges, brokers, and wallets, can add the new feature immediately, opening up the capability to their users, globally. A key element in the mission to enable anyone, anywhere to purchase any way, this integration is currently available to Simplex partners. One such Simplex partner that enables the sell of USDT is Poloniex. Poloniex, a leading crypto exchange platform, launched the feature offering great flexibility to their users. Commenting on the launch, Poloniex VP of Product and Business Development, Edward Leestated, \"We\\\\\\'re excited that our partnership with Simplex has enabled us to grow the ecosystem in many global markets and innovative ways.\" Commenting on the feature launch, Head of Marketing, Rachel Siegman stated, \"We are continuously pioneering new methods to grow the ecosystem and add value to our partner network. We are excited to offer our partners and their users the ability to easily and securely transact with Tether.\" By enabling the selling, as well as the purchase of USDT, on their partners\\\\\\' platforms, Simplex helps individuals around the world freely interact with the popular digital asset that lives on three different blockchains. Tether has come into its own this year, with 70% of exchange trade volume denominated in USDT pairs . In addition to being the leading base pair throughout Asia, the stablecoin is increasingly popular with Latin American users. As such, enabling the sell of USDT to their users helps exchanges and brokers grow their reach and expand to new markets. The recent fiat economic dip, as well as turbulence within the world of digital assets, has influenced the popularity of USDT. When turbulence threatens the price of assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), many traders instinctively swap into USDT to protect their positions. Cumulative USDT volume recently surpassed $600 billion, placing it ahead of PayPal for daily average transaction value. Story continues Tether dominates the expanding stablecoin market with a market cap of around $16 billion, having witnessed a fourfold increase in 2020. Because it is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, it represents a useful hybrid between the worlds of crypto and fiat, enabling swift and cheap transactions.

        "\n",
        "This dataset provides a daily, multimodal view of the Bitcoin ecosystem from **2015-01-01 to 2022-12-31**. It is designed for time-series forecasting and sentiment analysis tasks related to cryptocurrency price movements. Each row corresponds to a single day and contains a rich set of features, including:\n",
        "- Up to 30 raw, **full-text news articles** related to Bitcoin.\n",
        "- Up to 30 raw, full-text tweets mentioning Bitcoin.\n",
        "- The full text of a single random news article from the preceding 60 days for historical context.\n",
        "- The daily closing prices for Gold and Crude Oil.\n",
        "- A 60-day historical window of Bitcoin's closing price.\n",
        "- A 10-day future window of Bitcoin's closing price.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset is designed for tasks such as time-series forecasting, sentiment analysis, and multimodal machine learning to predict cryptocurrency price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Fields\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset includes the following columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `date` (date): The specific date for the data record in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n",
        "- `daily_news_full_text` (list of strings): A collection of up to 30 raw, **full-text news articles** published on the given `date`.\n",
        "- `daily_tweets` (list of strings): A collection of up to 30 raw, full-text tweets mentioning Bitcoin posted on the given `date`.\n",
        "- `contextual_past_article` (string): The complete, raw text of a single, randomly selected news article from the 60 days prior to the `date`, intended to provide historical context.\n",
        "- `gold_close_price` (float): The closing price of Gold futures (GC=F) for the day. Non-trading days are forward-filled with the last available price.\n",
        "- `oil_close_price` (float): The closing price of WTI Crude Oil futures (CL=F) for the day. Non-trading days are forward-filled with the last available price.\n",
        "- `btc_price_history_60d` (list of floats): A list containing the daily closing prices of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the 60 days *leading up to* the `date`. This serves as the primary historical feature set for time-series models.\n",
        "- `btc_price_target_10d` (list of floats): A list containing the daily closing prices of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the 10 days *following* the `date`. This is the intended **prediction target** for forecasting models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Curation and Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Raw Text:** The `daily_news_full_text` and `daily_tweets` fields contain unprocessed text. They have **not been summarized** and may require cleaning or embedding for use in models.\n",
        "- **Data Sources:**\n",
        "    - **Prices:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` library) for BTC-USD, GC=F, and CL=F.\n",
        "    - **News:** `edaschau/bitcoin_news` dataset on the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
        "    - **Tweets:** A user-provided `mbsa.csv` file.\n",
        "- **Missing Data:** Gaps in Gold and Oil prices due to market closures (weekends, holidays) have been filled using a forward-fill (`ffill`) strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Potential Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multimodal Price Prediction:** Build models that use text sentiment, financial indicators, and price history to forecast future Bitcoin prices.\n",
        "- **Sentiment-Driven Trading Strategy:** Analyze the sentiment of daily news and tweets and correlate it with market movements.\n",
        "- **Economic Indicator Analysis:** Study the correlation between Bitcoin's price and traditional commodities like Gold and Oil.\n",
