According to the analysis, investors should take time to understand the project before even considering an investment.Looking at the tokenomics of the Worldcoin token, launched on July 24, there are two absolute outliers. Firstly, the extremely high volume overtook the market cap, as the token reportedly traded 1.6 times its entire capitalization in the first 24 hours. How’s that even possible?According to Pechman, one must understand that the project has lent 100 million tokens to market makers. Only 8 million coins were handed out to users, who may or may not have flipped their positions, but this does not justify the $400 million reported volume.Now, on to the second part of the story, which Pechman finds even more concerning. Some 40% of the tokens will be unlocked between July 2024 and July 2025, and that’s 500x more than the 8 million currently awarded to users via airdrop.Ultimately, to maintain a market capitalization below Chainlink, for example, at $4 billion, the Worldcoin token price in July 2025 would have to be below $1, or 58% below the current level.That’s a huge risk for traders who are trying to capture 20% gains in the short term, given that there’s a huge amount of tokens from venture capitalists that paid much lower prices.Now, on to the show’s next topic: Pechman explores the Deribit Bitcoin volatility index, which reached its lowest level in two years. According to some analysts, that indicates a possible lack of price turbulence for Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future. But there’s a catch here, according to Pechman, as he does not believe the most likely outcome is lateral movement for Bitcoin.Want to know the rationale behind Pechman’s counterintuitive reading for the volatility indicator and how to position in this situation?

This forceful sell-off from whales alarmed investors, especially in the absence of any significant negative events impacting Bitcoin in the past month. Notably, a major concern stems from the ongoing court cases by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\\\\xa0against leading exchanges\\\\xa0Binance and Coinbase. Still, there hasn’t been any major advancement in those cases, which will likely take years to settle.Bitcoin’s price crash might have been related to the U.S. dollar reversionDespite historical volatility, Bitcoin’s crash became more pronounced following 33 consecutive days of trading within a tight 5.7% daily range. The movement is even more noteworthy given the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, crude oil rising by 2.4% and the MSCI China stock market index surging by 2.2%. However, it is essential to consider that the world’s largest global reserve asset, gold, experienced a dip of 0.5% on July 24. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reversed its two-month-long trend of devaluation against competing fiat currencies, climbing from 99.7 to 101.4 between July 18 and July 24.U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingViewThe DXY measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, including the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and others. If investors believe that the Federal Reserve will manage a soft landing successfully, it makes sense to reduce exposure to gold and Bitcoin while increasing positions in the stock market. Lower odds of a recession can positively impact corporate earnings.Margin and derivatives markets show resolute professional tradersTo understand whether Bitcoin’s price movement down to $29,000 has successfully ruptured the market structure, one should analyze margin and derivatives markets. Margin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency.OKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKXThe margin lending of OKX traders based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio rose between July 22 and July 24, suggesting that professional traders added leveraged long positions despite the recent price crash.Traders should corroborate this data with derivatives to ensure its marketwide impact. In healthy markets, BTC futures contracts typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium, known as contango, which is not exclusive to crypto.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: LaevitasNotice how the indicator sustained a healthy 5.7% average annualized premium, slightly lower than two days prior but still within the neutral range. This data confirms the resilience of margin markets, but to gauge market sentiment further, it’s also helpful to look at the\\\\xa0options markets.The 25% delta skew can reveal when arbitrage desks and market makers charge higher prices for protection against upside or downside movements. In short, a skew metric rising above 7% suggests traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin’s price, while periods of excitement generally yield a -7% skew.Bitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasThe 25% delta skew remained negative, indicating that bullish call options were trading at a premium compared to protective puts. This further supports the thesis that professional traders remain unfazed by the flash crash, with no evidence indicating pessimism among whales and market makers.The path to $30,000 and above shows the least resistanceIrrespective of the rationale behind the price move on July 24, Bitcoin bears could not dampen investor optimism, resulting in higher odds of a recovery above $30,000 in the short term. Notably, the mere appreciation of the U.S. dollar does not impact Bitcoin’s predictable monetary policy, censorship resistance and autonomous nature as a means of payment.On the brighter side, there are some positive triggers on the horizon, including the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund\\\\xa0and gaining regulatory clarity.

The South African diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, has revealed that all 54 African heads of state and the leaders of major Global South bodies have been invited to the summit.

Economist on Chinese Yuan and Reserve Currency The chief economist of South African financial services firm Nedbank, Nicky Weimar, discussed how a common BRICS currency could challenge the U.S. dollar’s hegemony last week, Independent Online reported. The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Noting that the economic bloc seeks to create a reserve currency on par with the U.S. dollar and reduce its dependency on the USD, Weimar emphasized that to achieve this goal: You need foreign exchange reserves and you need the trust of the investment community. The economist explained that the U.S. dollar became the global reserve currency due to the backing of the Federal Reserve, which the market trusted. “The U.S. has never defaulted on its debt. It’s given many people scary moments, but it’s never actually defaulted on its debt. The same cannot be said for any of the countries in the BRICS grouping. That’s the first problem,” Weimar described. Recently, the U.S. managed to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations amid a debt ceiling crisis. The second problem was that the only country in the BRICS economic bloc to carry such a reserve currency was China, Weimer described, adding: But China has capital controls. You cannot have a reserve currency if you have capital controls. So China in order to make this possible would have to undergo enormous financial liberalisation if they really want to compete with the dollar. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\\\\\'script\\\\\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\\\\\'text/javascript\\\\\\'; s.src = \\\\\\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\\\\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\\\\\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\\\\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Furthermore, the economist stressed: “They also can’t do it and then change course.

President Putin Greenlights Law Introducing Digital Ruble as New Form of Russian Fiat Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a bill providing the legal basis for the implementation of Russia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Tass news agency and other Russian media reported. The new federal law introduces a third, digital form of the national currency, the ruble, after cash and non-cash (bank) money. Putin’s signature opens the door for using the CBDC named “digital ruble” as a means of payment and for other transfers in the Russian Federation. These will be free of charge for citizens while businesses will pay a 0.3% commission on the amount transferred. Transactions with the digital currency will be processed through a dedicated information system — the digital ruble platform. Under the law, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is the sole issuer of the CBDC and will be the only operator of its payment system. The CBDC will be stored in digital wallets and accessed through the mobile apps of commercial banks. At the same time, the law does not permit users to open bank accounts with digital rubles or receive loans in the central bank digital currency. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\\\\\'script\\\\\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\\\\\'text/javascript\\\\\\'; s.src = \\\\\\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\\\\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\\\\\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\\\\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Ruble Remains the Only Legal Tender in Russia The legislation, which was passed earlier in July by both houses of Russian parliament, the State Duma and the Federation Council, introduces amendments to the country’s Civil Code. Its main provisions will enter into force on Aug. 1. The adoption of the law is viewed as part of Moscow’s efforts to not only offer an alternative for payments inside Russia but also find ways to circumvent financial restrictions imposed over its war in Ukraine. Last week, Governor Elvira Nabiullina revealed that the CBR is exploring options to integrate its platform with other CBDC systems to facilitate the use of the digital ruble in cross-border settlements. Russian officials have also been discussing the legalization of cryptocurrency payments, but only in foreign trade and under special legal regimes. Also this month, Putin signed a law effectively banning certain crypto payments for goods and services in Russia. This legislation requires exchanges for digital financial assets, or tokens issued on blockchains run by authorized operators, to reject transactions where these assets can be employed as “monetary surrogates.” At least for now, the ruble, in its different forms, remains the only legal tender in Russia which is yet to determine the legal status of decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

(Ripple). District Judge Analisa Torres&#x2019; highly anticipated order has been touted as a landmark victory by some digital asset lawyers and other professionals in the beleaguered industry. The SEC claimed Ripple and some of its senior leaders conducted unregistered offering and sale of &#x201C;crypto-asset securities&#x201D; in connection with its issuance of the XRP token (XRP). The following editorial was written by guest authors Wyatt Noble and Michael Handelsman for Kelman.Law Ripple vs. SEC Specifically, the SEC alleged in its complaint that Ripple sold more than 14.6 billion XRP, valued at more than $1.38 billion from 2013 through 2020, without filing a registration statement. According to the complaint these sales constituted a violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). Further, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an investment contract, which is a security under the SEC&#x2019;s jurisdiction according to the Securities Act (15 U.S.C &#xA7; 77b(a)(1)). The SEC alleged Ripple conducted three types of unregistered securities offerings: (1) programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges for which it received $757 million; (2) institutional sales under written contracts for which is received $728 million; and (3) other distributions under written contracts for which it recorded $609 million in &#x201C;consideration other than cash.&#x201D; How Judge Torres Ruled and Why In party holding for Ripple, the court considered whether XRP was an investment contract under the Howey Test, a legal doctrine that was developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co (328 U.S. 293 (1946)) to determine whether certain transactions are investment contracts. For the uninitiated, the Howey Test has three prongs: (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with the expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Cryptocurrency advocates and executives from centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken have argued for years that the Howey Test is incompatible with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. However, courts like the SDNY and regulatory agencies like the SEC appear to firmly believe the Howey Test is applicable to digital assets. Those who oppose applying the Howey Test tend to focus their arguments on the third prong, and argue that retail investors do not have a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others when buying from anonymous sellers through exchanges. Unsurprisingly, the third prong is where much of the controversy stemmed from in Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling. Judge Torres held under the Howey Test that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors on digital asset exchanges did not constitute the offer and sale of securities because those sales were blind bid/ask transactions and retail buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, another retail investor, or another seller of XRP. However, Judge Torres also held that Institutional sales of XRP did constitute the offer and sale of securities because institutional investors would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple&#x2019;s efforts, and Ripple led institutional investors to believe it would use the capital received from its institutional sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP ledger, in turn increasing the value of XRP. Additionally, other distributions were held not to constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because recipients of the other distributions did not pay money or &#x201C;some tangible and definable consideration&#x201D; to Ripple for their XRP. Many digital asset influencers, advocates, and even legal professionals have hailed the case as a decisive victory for both Ripple and the industry at large, claiming that Judge Torres essentially cemented that the XRP token itself is not a security and that her reasoning can and will be applied to other digital assets that have recently been subject to SEC scrutiny. However, the implications of this much-anticipated ruling are not yet certain and that may not change for several years. What Happens Next? The SEC will go back to the drawing board, and given that Chair, Gary Gensler, has already publicly expressed his disappointment with the ruling, an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals remains a possibility. Gensler&#x2019;s disappointment notwithstanding, an appeal could be risky for the SEC because the agency&#x2019;s jurisdiction over cryptocurrency markets could be reduced significantly if it appeals and loses. But part of this case &#x2013; that Ripple executives aided and abetted securities law violations in connection with institutional sales &#x2013; still has to go to trial, and SDNY has not yet set a date. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\\\\\'script\\\\\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\\\\\'text/javascript\\\\\\'; s.src = \\\\\\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\\\\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\\\\\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\\\\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); What Should You Do in the Meantime?

Hong Kong, China, 25th July 2023, Chainwire. Crypto platform Open Exchange (OPNX) has partnered with UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Magomed Kurbaitaev&#x2019;s new sports metaverse, Gameplan. The dynamic partnership will give fans an all-in-one destination for events, gaming, shopping, and interactions with their sports idols. Through partnering with innovative projects such as Khabib&#x2019;s Gameplan, OPNX aims to facilitate the next wave of crypto adoption and innovation, allowing athlete and fan interaction to thrive through Gameplan. OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb said &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long-term goal of mine to work with Khabib. Crypto and MMA have many parallels. It takes extreme skill to navigate the chaos in both cases. As an athlete, I&#x2019;ve always admired Khabib&#x2019;s composure and how he treats his opponents with the deepest respect. As much as his fights are exciting to watch, every one delivers a powerful lesson to his opponents. &#x201C;I believe MMA fighters bring the exact energy crypto needs in a bear market. We need true fighters right now, or what I internally refer to as Ox energy. People who persist with an indomitable resolve no matter the conditions. It&#x2019;s an honor to be partnered with Gameplan to further fan engagement and the lives of athletes everywhere.&#x201D; Khabib expressed his optimism about the new partnership, stating: &#x201C;As an athlete with big experience, I understand sport and what it needs. I hope this partnership between OPNX and Gameplan will revolutionize the sports industry.&#x201D; Historically, the sports industry has presented limited avenues for fans to interact with athletes and a narrow range of opportunities for athletes to leverage their skills and fame outside of sport. Gameplan aims to solve these issues by building a deeper connection between high-profile athletes and their supporters. This includes the biggest names in football, boxing, and wrestling. Users can own a stake in their favorite sports teams and contribute to the platform&#x2019;s decision-making process through token-based voting. Leveraging Gameplan&#x2019;s native utility token, users can influence decisions related to team management, strategy, and much more. During gameplay, users can also engage with an AI-powered Khabib, a...\\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\\n- Reddit (sample): []\\n\\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\\nOhh, it’s time.\\nTime for anothercrypto macro brief.\\nCancel your dates (ha, good one!), call your loved ones (no,seriously) and barricade the door.

Some wear suits:\\nTheBlackRock Bitcoin Spot ETFapplication is a big deal. But the real news was how it seemed to trigger an avalanche of institutional interest in the crypto industry. Let’s see, we have…\\n• Deutsche Bankapplying for a crypto custody license. Yes, the same Deutsche Bank that described Bitcoin as an asset based on “wishful thinking” in 2021.\\n• EDX, a crypto exchange backed by Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, finally went live. Ok, they did not exactly hit refresh on the top cryptocurrencies since the exchange only offersBitcoin,Ether,Litecoin, andBitcoin Cashtrading thus far. But it’s backed by some big fish. (Here is an extraexplaineron EDX.)\\n• Mastercardfiled a trademark application to develop crypto software. Probably nothing.\\n• Invesco, another institutional investment company, re-applied for a Bitcoin Spot ETF. Let’s see — they have only $1.4 trillionassets under managementcompared to BlackRock’s $10T but hey, any little counts.\\n• Valkyriefiling for a spot ETF as well. Ticker name $BRRR. Legends.\\n• Santander, Spain’s largest bank, showed interest in theLightning Network. Again, probably nothing.\\n• BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard with increased exposure in MSTR. Michael Saylor loves to hear it.\\n• TheGBTC share pricesurged after news of the spot application broke.\\n• Oh, andcrypto-native asset managershopped on the spot ETF bandwagon because you might as well if BlackRock does.\\nAnd yes, all of that happened in the span of a few days (except for the MSTR piece). TheQ1 macro briefclosed with the following conclusion:\\n“Macro in 2023 will set the tone for crypto’s medium-term price development.”\\nThat seems more true than ever. Butlet’s not get ahead of ourselves. Can the spot ETF really get the thumbs-up from*gasp*theSEC?\\nSo far, Gary Gensler has been steadfast in his agency’s position on Bitcoin Spot ETFs. They are a no-no:\\nBut why?\\nIs this even important and why could this be your last chance to make it?\\nWell, where there’s a narrative, there’s a way for crypto to print a big greendildo:\\nIn other words, yes, it would be a big deal to get this approved. Bitcoin would get the “BlackRock stamp of approval” for other institutions and anyone of rank and file in tardfi, pardon, traditional finance to ape into Bitcoin. AsGeorge Kaloudisargues, it would also be a boon forliquiditybut could come with someundesired side effects.\\nBecause, asthis threadexplains, some of the fine print in the application will not be to the liking of Bitcoiners. Things like:\\n• Not everyone is able to redeem their BTC, but only those handpicked by BlackRock.\\n• The potential for a lot ofrehypothecatedBTC to be created (read: a lot of paper bitcoin).\\n• BlackRock redeems the right to accept whichhard forkit considers the “true chain” if such a thing happens. Cue the conspiracy theories of a “BlackRock Bitcoin chain.”\\nRead also:TrustvsETFvsBitcoin ETF─ what is the difference?\\nBut can BlackRock’s amazing streak of 575-1 ETF approvals overcome the winless Bitcoin Spot ETF streak?\\nThe asset management firm seems to be confident it can with thisone weird trick(the SEC hates it!) to get your Bitcoin Spot ETF application approv,ed ─ a surveillance sharing agreement between NASDAQ and an approved exchange.\\nYou see, the SEC has been slapping down applications for fear of “price manipulation.” And since it does not consider any significant exchange legit (except for, you know,Prometheum), the answer to all applications so far has been…no.\\nCan it get done this time then?\\nOpinions on Crypto Twitter differ.\\nNoelle Acheson, former Head of Research at CoinDesk, thinks it’smore of a political messageto the Democratic Party, which BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink is affiliated with, to go easy on the whole “banning crypto” trip:\\nJustin Slaughter, Policy Director at Paradigm, disagrees. His take is thatBlackRock have the influence and the timing to get it approved, as theGrayscale vs SEC lawsuitmay end with a defeat for the SEC (and open the door for a “crypto-native” spot ETF to be first):\\nNic Carter agreed. He suggested the SEC may in fact have given BlackRock a silent nod of approval to get first in line:\\nThe entire narrative shows:institutions are more bullish than they let on. Some form of crypto seems inevitable, so might as well try to take the degens’ plaything away.\\nNow surely, this wasreally bullishfor Bitcoin, wasn’t it?\\nNot much of a cliffhanger here. Yes,Bitcointeleported back to over $30K on the tsunami of (hopefully) good news.\\nEven a look under the hood suggests this is good for our favorite orange coin.\\nThe rally is beingdriven by spot buyinginstead of a short squeeze:\\nAnd who’s been violently slamming the “long” button on exchanges? Turns out, it’s beenthe Americans:\\nAnother good sign:stablecoin inflowis finally turning positive and has recorded its first two-week uptick since February:\\nSo it’s all good again? Bull market here we come?\\nOh you know what’s coming now.The m-m-m-macro summary.\\nSo. The Fed recently changed course and stopped hiking rates. Enter the new “macro main character” ─the hawkish pause.\\nWhat is this, you ask?\\nWell, when the Fed tries to pause rate hikes but doesn’t want everyone diving in head-first into JPEG and frog coin trading, they cloak their decision with a lot of spooky talk about how that’s only a temporary breather:\\nRead also:Rate Hikes and the Fed – How Do They Affect Crypto Markets?\\nTo the Fed’s credit, it has been doing exactly what it has been telegraphing it would do. So no reason to doubt a rate hike coming in July, right?\\nThe markets don’t see it that way though.\\nWith inflation coming down (for now), some commentators on Twitter wonder whether thebear marketin equities is actually a thing of the past:\\nIn case you are not following equities, they have been printing for the last few weeks, which is not the kind of decoupling crypto investors wanted to see. Time for crypto to catch up now?\\nOverall, the theme is that it’sa game of chicken between the Fed and the market. And at the moment, it seems the Fed is winning:\\nSo that would be a bearish catalyst for the crypto market. How about the long term though?\\nHere’s the deal. Leading up to thehalvingnext year, you should not expect any magic from the crypto markets due to volatility, volume and realized value at multi-year lows.Glassnoderead the on-chain tea leaves, and the market is likely in an accumulation phase, marked by boredom and investor disinterest.\\nAsBitcoin Magazinepoints out, 2018 also saw a rally and more sideways crab.The market can stay boring longer than you can stay disciplined.\\nWith that being said, let’s listen to someCrypto Twitter hopiumon where an ETF approval could take prices in the really long run.\\nHow about a cycle of institutional money buying our bags, followed by government:\\nIn any case, Bitcoin is likely going to enter the political mainstream really soon:\\nHere’s another dose of hopium by Adam Cochran, who suggests even a sprinkle of institution-controlled Boomer pension money could cause a15X for crypto prices:\\nIf it does happen though ─ the final approval would be in eight months ─ Crypto Twitter isn’t expecting prices to teleport immediately. There still seems to be some bear market PTSD at play:\\nWhatever the outcome,crypto isn’t going awayany time soon. The show must go on!\\n\\nYou are given the ground-truth NEXT 10 daily BTC closing prices for supervision.\\nYOUR JOB:\\n1) Provide a concise, evidence-based analysis explaining how the news, tweets, macro/commodity data,\\n   on-chain metrics, sentiment, and the 60-day price history plausibly affected the NEXT 10 days.\\n2) List the key drivers (what, direction, and why) that most influenced the realized path.\\n3) Give a short-term trading stance (BUY/SELL/HOLD) with 1–2 sentence rationale and a confidence (1–99).\\n4) Echo the GIVEN 10-day prices exactly in order (do not modify), so we can align analysis with outcomes.\\n\\nSTRICT OUTPUT FORMAT — JSON ONLY (no prose outside JSON):\\n{\\n  \"analysis\": \"<3–8 sentences grounded in the provided context>\",\\n  \"drivers\": [\\n    {\"factor\":\"<e.g., CPI surprise, ETF flows, regulatory action, on-chain activity>\", \"direction\":\"up|down|mixed\", \"why\":\"<brief causal explanation>\"},\\n    {\"factor\":\"<...>\", \"direction\":\"up|down|mixed\", \"why\":\"<...>\"}\\n  ],\\n  \"recommendation\": \"BUY\" | \"SELL\" | \"HOLD\",\\n  \"confidence\": <int 1-99>,\\n  \"forecast_10d_given\": [<repeat the 10 prices exactly as given, numeric array>]\\n}\\nNo markdown, no code fences, no extra commentary.\\n\\nGIVEN_10_DAY_PRICES: [29354.97, 29210.69, 29319.25, 29356.92, 29275.31, 29230.11, 29675.73, 29151.96, 29178.68, 29074.09]'"

    "# 🔧 CONTEXT WINDOW FIXES IMPLEMENTED\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ **The Problem You Had:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "API Error 400: ContextWindowExceededError: This model's maximum context length is 16384 tokens. \n",
    "However, you requested 27188 tokens (23092 in the messages, 4096 in the completion).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Fixes I've Applied:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Aggressive Prompt Trimming**\n",
    "- Reduced `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS` from 100,000 → 12,000 characters\n",
    "- Enhanced `trim_prompt()` function with better logic\n",
    "- Keeps 70% from beginning (instructions) + 30% from end (recent data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Token Estimation & Safety**\n",
    "- Added `estimate_tokens()` function (rough: 4 chars ≈ 1 token)\n",
    "- Added `safe_api_call()` with pre-call token checking\n",
    "- Conservative limits: 12k chars ≈ 3k tokens (safe for 16k limit)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**\n",
    "- Specific detection for context window errors\n",
    "- Automatic retry with even smaller prompts (8k chars)\n",
    "- Better error messages and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Parallel Processing Improvements**\n",
    "- Each worker handles context errors independently\n",
    "- Better load balancing across workers\n",
    "- Real-time error tracking and reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 **Results:**\n",
    "- ✅ Successfully trimmed 22k+ token prompts → 3k tokens\n",
    "- ✅ API calls now work without context errors\n",
    "- ✅ Maintained parallel processing speed\n",
    "- ✅ Preserved data quality with smart truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **Ready to Use:**\n",
    "Your parallel API processing should now work perfectly without context window errors!"

Digital asset funds overall witnessed weekly outflows of $6.5 million after gaining $742 million of inflows through the previous four weeks. The trend turnabout came as BTC investors have seemingly run out of positive news to bid on after some major catalysts in recent weeks.

      "After a rough 2022, bitcoin mining is swinging upward, as CoinDesk analyst George Kaloudis writes. The bear market that sapped prices and publicly traded miners' stocks tumbling has lessened this year. Crypto mining is now mostly healthy. Bitcoin network’s hashrate, a measure of the amount of computing power committed to running the network, shows a bountiful capacity with which to run crypto’s premier network. As of July 21, Bitcoin’s hashrate was400 exahash per second, up five-fold from June 2021. And a number of miners have returned to report healthy margins, especially those that have access to cheap energy like TeraWulf (WULF) and CipherMining (CIPHER), whose gross margins in Q1 2023 exceeded 60% (see below).\n",

According to the analysis, investors should take time to understand the project before even considering an investment.Looking at the tokenomics of the Worldcoin token, launched on July 24, there are two absolute outliers. Firstly, the extremely high volume overtook the market cap, as the token reportedly traded 1.6 times its entire capitalization in the first 24 hours. How’s that even possible?According to Pechman, one must understand that the project has lent 100 million tokens to market makers. Only 8 million coins were handed out to users, who may or may not have flipped their positions, but this does not justify the $400 million reported volume.Now, on to the second part of the story, which Pechman finds even more concerning. Some 40% of the tokens will be unlocked between July 2024 and July 2025, and that’s 500x more than the 8 million currently awarded to users via airdrop.Ultimately, to maintain a market capitalization below Chainlink, for example, at $4 billion, the Worldcoin token price in July 2025 would have to be below $1, or 58% below the current level.That’s a huge risk for traders who are trying to capture 20% gains in the short term, given that there’s a huge amount of tokens from venture capitalists that paid much lower prices.Now, on to the show’s next topic: Pechman explores the Deribit Bitcoin volatility index, which reached its lowest level in two years. According to some analysts, that indicates a possible lack of price turbulence for Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future. But there’s a catch here, according to Pechman, as he does not believe the most likely outcome is lateral movement for Bitcoin.Want to know the rationale behind Pechman’s counterintuitive reading for the volatility indicator and how to position in this situation? Get those answers in the latest The Market Report, a show that runs exclusively on the new\\xa0Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\\n'], [113195, 'bitcoin-price-is-down-but-data-signals-that-30k-is-the-path-of-least-resistance', 8171, 'Bitcoin price is down, but data signals that $30K and above is the path of least resistance', '2023-07-25 21:39:55', 'Even with a price correction to $29,000, several Bitcoin price metrics show traders casting bets on a quick rebound. ', 'On July 24, Bitcoin\\xa0experienced a flash crash, plummeting to $29,000 in a movement now attributed to significant Bitcoin holders potentially liquidating their positions.\\xa0Amid the crash and market uncertainty, Bitcoin’s (BTC)\\xa0three major trading metrics continue to project a bullish outlook, signifying that professional traders have not reduced their leverage longs through the use of margin and derivatives.Analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in whales’ inflows to exchanges, reaching their highest level in over three years at 41% of the total BTC inflows. This forceful sell-off from whales alarmed investors, especially in the absence of any significant negative events impacting Bitcoin in the past month. Notably, a major concern stems from the ongoing court cases by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\\xa0against leading exchanges\\xa0Binance and Coinbase. Still, there hasn’t been any major advancement in those cases, which will likely take years to settle.Bitcoin’s price crash might have been related to the U.S. dollar reversionDespite historical volatility, Bitcoin’s crash became more pronounced following 33 consecutive days of trading within a tight 5.7% daily range. The movement is even more noteworthy given the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, crude oil rising by 2.4% and the MSCI China stock market index surging by 2.2%. However, it is essential to consider that the world’s largest global reserve asset, gold, experienced a dip of 0.5% on July 24. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reversed its two-month-long trend of devaluation against competing fiat currencies, climbing from 99.7 to 101.4 between July 18 and July 24.U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingViewThe DXY measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, including the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and others. If investors believe that the Federal Reserve will manage a soft landing successfully, it makes sense to reduce exposure to gold and Bitcoin while increasing positions in the stock market. Lower odds of a recession can positively impact corporate earnings.Margin and derivatives markets show resolute professional tradersTo understand whether Bitcoin’s price movement down to $29,000 has successfully ruptured the market structure, one should analyze margin and derivatives markets. Margin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency.OKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKXThe margin lending of OKX traders based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio rose between July 22 and July 24, suggesting that professional traders added leveraged long positions despite the recent price crash.Traders should corroborate this data with derivatives to ensure its marketwide impact. In healthy markets, BTC futures contracts typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium, known as contango, which is not exclusive to crypto.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: LaevitasNotice how the indicator sustained a healthy 5.7% average annualized premium, slightly lower than two days prior but still within the neutral range. This data confirms the resilience of margin markets, but to gauge market sentiment further, it’s also helpful to look at the\\xa0options markets.The 25% delta skew can reveal when arbitrage desks and market makers charge higher prices for protection against upside or downside movements. In short, a skew metric rising above 7% suggests traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin’s price, while periods of excitement generally yield a -7% skew.Bitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: LaevitasThe 25% delta skew remained negative, indicating that bullish call options were trading at a premium compared to protective puts. This further supports the thesis that professional traders remain unfazed by the flash crash, with no evidence indicating pessimism among whales and market makers.The path to $30,000 and above shows the least resistanceIrrespective of the rationale behind the price move on July 24, Bitcoin bears could not dampen investor optimism, resulting in higher odds of a recovery above $30,000 in the short term. Notably, the mere appreciation of the U.S. dollar does not impact Bitcoin’s predictable monetary policy, censorship resistance and autonomous nature as a means of payment.On the brighter side, there are some positive triggers on the horizon, including the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund\\xa0and gaining regulatory clarity. Proof of this comes from a U.S. bill introduced on July 20 that seeks to establish a clear process for determining the classification of digital assets as commodities or securities.

The economist explained that the U.S. dollar became the global reserve currency due to the backing of the Federal Reserve, which the market trusted. “The U.S. has never defaulted on its debt. It’s given many people scary moments, but it’s never actually defaulted on its debt. The same cannot be said for any of the countries in the BRICS grouping. That’s the first problem,” Weimar described. Recently, the U.S. managed to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations amid a debt ceiling crisis. The second problem was that the only country in the BRICS economic bloc to carry such a reserve currency was China, Weimer described, adding: But China has capital controls. You cannot have a reserve currency if you have capital controls. So China in order to make this possible would have to undergo enormous financial liberalisation if they really want to compete with the dollar. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Furthermore, the economist stressed: “They also can’t do it and then change course. They would have to do it and stick with it to gain the trust of the investor. So this is miles away because, ultimately, you must gain the trust of the investor. A currency only has value if people believe it has value. And that trust has got to be there. So they’ve got a long journey ahead of them.&#8221; Noting that China has the ability to do this, but huge changes must be implemented, she opined: “I don’t actually see them talking along those lines. It’s almost like they haven’t made that connection yet that you need to let go of some of the control. You also need to always be willing to provide it.&#8221; Do you agree with Nedbank’s chief economist?

The new legislation, which legalizes and regulates the use of Bank of Russia’s digital currency for payments and other transactions, will enter into force on Aug. 1. President Putin Greenlights Law Introducing Digital Ruble as New Form of Russian Fiat Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a bill providing the legal basis for the implementation of Russia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Tass news agency and other Russian media reported. The new federal law introduces a third, digital form of the national currency, the ruble, after cash and non-cash (bank) money. Putin’s signature opens the door for using the CBDC named “digital ruble” as a means of payment and for other transfers in the Russian Federation. These will be free of charge for citizens while businesses will pay a 0.3% commission on the amount transferred. Transactions with the digital currency will be processed through a dedicated information system — the digital ruble platform. Under the law, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is the sole issuer of the CBDC and will be the only operator of its payment system. The CBDC will be stored in digital wallets and accessed through the mobile apps of commercial banks. At the same time, the law does not permit users to open bank accounts with digital rubles or receive loans in the central bank digital currency. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Ruble Remains the Only Legal Tender in Russia The legislation, which was passed earlier in July by both houses of Russian parliament, the State Duma and the Federation Council, introduces amendments to the country’s Civil Code. Its main provisions will enter into force on Aug. 1. The adoption of the law is viewed as part of Moscow’s efforts to not only offer an alternative for payments inside Russia but also find ways to circumvent financial restrictions imposed over its war in Ukraine. Last week, Governor Elvira Nabiullina revealed that the CBR is exploring options to integrate its platform with other CBDC systems to facilitate the use of the digital ruble in cross-border settlements. Russian officials have also been discussing the legalization of cryptocurrency payments, but only in foreign trade and under special legal regimes. Also this month, Putin signed a law effectively banning certain crypto payments for goods and services in Russia. This legislation requires exchanges for digital financial assets, or tokens issued on blockchains run by authorized operators, to reject transactions where these assets can be employed as “monetary surrogates.” At least for now, the ruble, in its different forms, remains the only legal tender in Russia which is yet to determine the legal status of decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

(Ripple). District Judge Analisa Torres&#x2019; highly anticipated order has been touted as a landmark victory by some digital asset lawyers and other professionals in the beleaguered industry. The SEC claimed Ripple and some of its senior leaders conducted unregistered offering and sale of &#x201C;crypto-asset securities&#x201D; in connection with its issuance of the XRP token (XRP). The following editorial was written by guest authors Wyatt Noble and Michael Handelsman for Kelman.Law Ripple vs. SEC Specifically, the SEC alleged in its complaint that Ripple sold more than 14.6 billion XRP, valued at more than $1.38 billion from 2013 through 2020, without filing a registration statement. According to the complaint these sales constituted a violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). Further, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an investment contract, which is a security under the SEC&#x2019;s jurisdiction according to the Securities Act (15 U.S.C &#xA7; 77b(a)(1)). The SEC alleged Ripple conducted three types of unregistered securities offerings: (1) programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges for which it received $757 million; (2) institutional sales under written contracts for which is received $728 million; and (3) other distributions under written contracts for which it recorded $609 million in &#x201C;consideration other than cash.&#x201D; How Judge Torres Ruled and Why In party holding for Ripple, the court considered whether XRP was an investment contract under the Howey Test, a legal doctrine that was developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co (328 U.S. 293 (1946)) to determine whether certain transactions are investment contracts. For the uninitiated, the Howey Test has three prongs: (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with the expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Cryptocurrency advocates and executives from centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken have argued for years that the Howey Test is incompatible with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. However, courts like the SDNY and regulatory agencies like the SEC appear to firmly believe the Howey Test is applicable to digital assets. Those who oppose applying the Howey Test tend to focus their arguments on the third prong, and argue that retail investors do not have a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others when buying from anonymous sellers through exchanges. Unsurprisingly, the third prong is where much of the controversy stemmed from in Judge Torres&#x2019; ruling. Judge Torres held under the Howey Test that programmatic sales of XRP to retail investors on digital asset exchanges did not constitute the offer and sale of securities because those sales were blind bid/ask transactions and retail buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, another retail investor, or another seller of XRP. However, Judge Torres also held that Institutional sales of XRP did constitute the offer and sale of securities because institutional investors would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple&#x2019;s efforts, and Ripple led institutional investors to believe it would use the capital received from its institutional sales to improve the market for XRP and develop uses for the XRP ledger, in turn increasing the value of XRP. Additionally, other distributions were held not to constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts because recipients of the other distributions did not pay money or &#x201C;some tangible and definable consideration&#x201D; to Ripple for their XRP. Many digital asset influencers, advocates, and even legal professionals have hailed the case as a decisive victory for both Ripple and the industry at large, claiming that Judge Torres essentially cemented that the XRP token itself is not a security and that her reasoning can and will be applied to other digital assets that have recently been subject to SEC scrutiny. However, the implications of this much-anticipated ruling are not yet certain and that may not change for several years. What Happens Next? The SEC will go back to the drawing board, and given that Chair, Gary Gensler, has already publicly expressed his disappointment with the ruling, an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals remains a possibility. Gensler&#x2019;s disappointment notwithstanding, an appeal could be risky for the SEC because the agency&#x2019;s jurisdiction over cryptocurrency markets could be reduced significantly if it appeals and loses. But part of this case &#x2013; that Ripple executives aided and abetted securities law violations in connection with institutional sales &#x2013; still has to go to trial, and SDNY has not yet set a date. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); What Should You Do in the Meantime?

Hong Kong, China, 25th July 2023, Chainwire. Crypto platform Open Exchange (OPNX) has partnered with UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Magomed Kurbaitaev&#x2019;s new sports metaverse, Gameplan. The dynamic partnership will give fans an all-in-one destination for events, gaming, shopping, and interactions with their sports idols. Through partnering with innovative projects such as Khabib&#x2019;s Gameplan, OPNX aims to facilitate the next wave of crypto adoption and innovation, allowing athlete and fan interaction to thrive through Gameplan. OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb said &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long-term goal of mine to work with Khabib. Crypto and MMA have many parallels. It takes extreme skill to navigate the chaos in both cases. As an athlete, I&#x2019;ve always admired Khabib&#x2019;s composure and how he treats his opponents with the deepest respect. As much as his fights are exciting to watch, every one delivers a powerful lesson to his opponents. &#x201C;I believe MMA fighters bring the exact energy crypto needs in a bear market. We need true fighters right now, or what I internally refer to as Ox energy. People who persist with an indomitable resolve no matter the conditions. It&#x2019;s an honor to be partnered with Gameplan to further fan engagement and the lives of athletes everywhere.&#x201D; Khabib expressed his optimism about the new partnership, stating: &#x201C;As an athlete with big experience, I understand sport and what it needs. I hope this partnership between OPNX and Gameplan will revolutionize the sports industry.&#x201D; Historically, the sports industry has presented limited avenues for fans to interact with athletes and a narrow range of opportunities for athletes to leverage their skills and fame outside of sport. Gameplan aims to solve these issues by building a deeper connection between high-profile athletes and their supporters. This includes the biggest names in football, boxing, and wrestling. Users can own a stake in their favorite sports teams and contribute to the platform&#x2019;s decision-making process through token-based voting. Leveraging Gameplan&#x2019;s native utility token, users can influence decisions related to team management, strategy, and much more.

    "## 📋 What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook processes your Bitcoin price prediction dataset by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading** the base dataset from Hugging Face\n",
    "2. **Enriching** it with DeepSeek-V3.1 API responses for financial analysis\n",
    "3. **Normalizing** the responses into structured format\n",
    "4. **Uploading** the final enriched dataset back to Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Load Dataset\n",
    "Run the first cell to load your base dataset from Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Test Connection  \n",
    "Run the API test cell to verify DeepSeek connection works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Run Processing\n",
    "Choose one of these options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Option A: Test with small batch (recommended first)\n",
    "run_parallel(dataset, [API_KEY], start_idx=0, end_idx=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option B: Process specific range\n",
    "run_parallel(dataset, [API_KEY], start_idx=0, end_idx=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option C: Process entire dataset (careful - this uses API quota!)\n",
    "run_parallel(dataset, [API_KEY])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Upload Results\n",
    "Run the final cell to upload your enriched dataset to Hugging Face.\n",
